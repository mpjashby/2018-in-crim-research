"8889","Governing Illicit Finance in Transnational Security Spaces: the Fatf and Anti-Money Laundering","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>This article analyzes the global anti-money laundering (AML) regime from the perspective of security governance, examining the creation of a transnational security space by the FATF. Security is often mentioned as relevant context for AML measures, and the Financial Action Taskforce (FATF) as its central institution. Yet, most analyses &ndash; implicitly or explicitly &ndash; present the FATF as an important banking regulator. Arguing that this perspective on the FATF is too limited, the article outlines the changing security context in which AML emerged as an important tool for governance. Unlike traditional ideas of international security, the idea of security governance emphasizes new forms of cooperation to ensure safety and security across multiple levels. Based on International Relations (IR) and criminological research, the article develops a framework with five dimensions of security governance: a comprehensive security concept, multi-purpose rationalization, public-private cooperation, multi-nodal governance, and transnational security spaces as a result. Unlike other efforts of global crime governance, the global AML regime provides a prime example of security governance in all of these dimensions. At the same time, the link to security also explains why the global AML regime expanded in some areas more than in others: AML is still a weak governance instrument for regulating financial crimes such as tax evasion or corruption, but it is a strong one for security-related crimes. While the FATF remains a special case in global governance, the creation of transnational security spaces in AML &ndash; caused by FATF activities &ndash; is likely to be a model for future security governance in other fields.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10611-017-9750-y","2018-01-02 10:15:22","48","Crime, Law and Social Change"

"8891","Client Privilege, Compliance and the Rule of Law: Swedish Lawyers and Money Laundering Prevention","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>Can, and will, lawyers police their clients? This article aims to shed light on the private front-line workers of the Financial Action Task Force on money laundering (FATF). The analysis is based on a study of how Swedish lawyers perceive and handle obligations to police clients within FATF style risk-based anti-money laundering/counter terrorism (AML/CTF) regulation. We find that the lawyers were reluctant to taking on the responsibility for AML/CTF, and that their front-line work was directed towards being compliant enough. Relatedly, we identify several practices of separation that serve to mediate between the conflicting aims and interests in the everyday of this form of private policing. Another finding is that the lawyers by and large position themselves as knowledgeable actors, and view risks of AML/CTF as knowable. Nevertheless, lawyers experienced a principle clash between being &lsquo;not banks&rsquo;, and being front-line workers for FATF. In particular, the lawyers perceived their role as front-line workers to be more complex due to their professional norms and ethics on client privilege, and what they saw as the proper role of lawyers, being in conflict with the obligation to report clients and their transactions. In concluding, we suggest that paying more attention to the everyday experience of front-line workers when devising regulatory tools may be a way to promote engagement in &lsquo;true&rsquo; crime prevention on their part.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10611-017-9753-8","2018-01-02 11:30:25","51","Crime, Law and Social Change"

"8894","Sexual Violence on Campus: No Evidence That Studies Are Biased Due to Self-Selection","<p>Numerous research studies suggest that at least one in five female college students is sexually assaulted while enrolled. However, many studies exploring sexual violence prevalence on campus use methodology permitting students to self-select into the study based on interest in the topic (i.e., students receive an email offering them the opportunity to participate in a study on sexual violence). Self-selection may bias these prevalence estimates of campus sexual violence. To explore this issue, we surveyed two samples of college women on their experiences of sexual assault. We recruited Sample 1 in a typical way: by emailing a randomly selected subset of students provided by the university registrar and inviting participation with information about the survey topic. We recruited Sample 2 using a human subjects pool where students in introductory psychology and linguistics courses sign up for studies without prior knowledge about the topic of the research they will participate in (hence greatly minimizing the risk of self-selection). The two samples yielded nearly identical victimization rates. Over a quarter of participants in both our samples had experienced sexual contact without consent, consistent with recent research from the Association of American Universities. College victimization estimates do not appear to be biased by self-selection based on knowledge of the survey topic.</p>","http://digitalcommons.uri.edu/dignity/vol3/iss1/7","2018-01-02 20:45:37","83","Dignity: A Journal on Sexual Exploitation and Violence"

Among adolescents, sexual harassment may increase with both their emerging sexual desires and increased socializing in mixed-gender peer groups during early adolescence. We set out to study the possible associations between normative and risk-taking sexual behavior and subjection to sexual harassment among adolescents between the ages of 14 and 18&#8239;years. The informants included 90,953 boys and 91,746 girls, with a mean (SD) age of 16.3 (1.2) years, who responded to a classroom survey (School Health Promotion Study 2010&ndash;2011) in Finland. We found that even early steps in romantic and erotic experiences were associated with experiences of sexual harassment. The more advanced the adolescents&rsquo; sexual experiences were, the more commonly they reported differing experiences of sexual harassment. These associations were particularly strong among the girls. Among the sexually active adolescents, the more partners the adolescents had for intercourse, the more commonly they reported experiences of sexual harassment. Adolescents actively interested in romantic and sexual relationships may socialize in contexts where sexual harassment is more likely to occur. They may be more sensitive to sexual cues than their non-interested peers, or sexual harassment may be a traumatic experience predisposing adolescents to risk-taking sexual behavior as a form of acting out. A double standard regarding the appropriate expression of sexuality received some support in our data.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213417304623%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D4abceee826f9a34aa86ba0dff6ea6138","2018-01-02 21:30:17","69","Child Abuse and Neglect"

In this study, we examine the relationship between maternal negative emotional expression and mothers&rsquo; use of disciplinary methods (psychological aggression, corporal punishment and physical maltreatment) and the moderating effects of educational attainment in Chinese societies. Five hundred and sixteen mothers with preschool-aged children were recruited to participate in this research. The Chinese versions of the Self-Expressiveness in the Family Questionnaire (SEFQ) and the Parent-Child Conflict Tactics Scales (CTSPC) were used to measure the mothers&rsquo; negative emotional expression and discipline, respectively. The results suggested that the mothers&rsquo; negative emotional expression was positively related to their disciplinary behaviors. Moreover, maternal educational attainment moderated the association between negative emotional expression and discipline.

We explored several offender demographic characteristics associated with who re-offended and found that civilians re-offended at a similar rate as active duty members, males re-offended at a similar rate as females, and younger offenders were more likely to re-offend than older offenders. We also explored incident characteristics associated with who re-offended: Re-offending was more likely if the initial maltreatment was neglect or emotional abuse and re-offenders were likely to perpetrate subsequent maltreatment that was the same type and severity as their initial incident. The current data indicate that young offenders and offenders of neglect and emotional maltreatment are the greatest risk of re-offending. These offender and incident characteristics could be used by the USAF to guide their efforts to reduce re-offending.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213417304751%26_version%3D1%26md5%3De507ad213929d72044710ffce24f6933","2018-01-03 21:30:16","65","Child Abuse and Neglect"

                  <p>Despite the advent of modern crime control methods, chiefly brought about by technological advancement, foot patrol has remained as one of the crucial crime prevention methods in both the developed and developing world. This study was aimed at describing the implementation of foot beat patrols in Harare Central Business District (CBD), Zimbabwe. The study also attempted to gauge perceptions from police officers on the effectiveness of foot beat patrols as a crime control strategy. The study revealed that hot spot patrols and high visibility are the most widely used patrol initiatives in Harare CBD. Foot patrols were widely viewed to be effective in reducing specific crimes/problems such as assault, loitering, touts, plain robbery and pick pocketing. It was also felt that reduction in specific crimes within the central business district also lowers the aggregate crime levels for the whole city. Reduction in fear of crime and provision of a reassuring presence were also considered to be the major benefits of foot patrols by community representatives.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1057/s41300-017-0038-z","2018-01-04 08:15:21","54","Crime Prevention and Community Safety"

                  <p>Children and their caregivers often disagree when reporting on child behavioural and emotional difficulties. But how does <em>parent&ndash;child discordance</em> relate to outcomes, particularly among children undergoing trauma therapy? This study examined parent&ndash;child discordance in relation to children&rsquo;s trauma symptoms and therapy outcomes. Participants included 96 trauma-exposed children and their caregivers, who received Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. Discordance was calculated using absolute difference scores between child- and parent- reported psychological symptoms. Parent&ndash;child discordance, calculated at pre-therapy, post-therapy, and at a six-month follow-up, predicted the severity of children&rsquo;s posttraumatic stress, dissociation, and internalizing and externalizing difficulties at each respective time-point. Pre-therapy discordance predicted improvements in externalizing behaviours after therapy and at follow-up. Improvements in discordance predicted improvements in trauma-specific symptoms over the course of treatment and at follow-up. The findings underscore how changes in parent&ndash;child discordance are related to child trauma symptoms and treatment response. Clinical implications and future directions are discussed.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-017-9948-x","2018-01-04 14:16:13","48","Journal of Family Violence"

                  <p>To explore the problematic of forgiveness in criminal justice we argue for and utilise the deep homologies that exist between the continental philosophical tradition and approaches to complexity theory (the potential to realise new dynamical states). Through taking a hermeneutical narrative approach we argue that studied together they provide us with new insights into questions of punishment, retribution and rehabilitation and enable us to better understand the connections that exist between victims of crime, perpetrators and the community through examination of the content of dominant narratives that emerge in the historical relationship between theology and law; gain insight into an increased path lock (entropic justice) with respect to retribution in liberal democracies such as the USA and UK based upon decomposition of the Judaeo-Christian message; and examine what contemporary stories of forgiveness reveal with respect to accessing new dynamical states and new ways of doing justice that challenge dominant and reductionist narrative.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10612-017-9383-6","2018-01-04 15:30:46","52","Critical Criminology"

For this purpose, a survey was conducted of students from middle schools and high schools in four regions of South Korea. A total of 1170 middle-school students who reported using smartphone took part in this study. A multiple mediator model was analyzed using the bootstrapping mediation methods Parental neglect was significantly associated with adolescents&rsquo; smartphone addiction. Furthermore, in the relationship between parental neglect and smartphone addiction, parental neglect was not significantly associated with the relational maladjustment with peers, whereas the relational maladjustment with peers negatively influenced smartphone addiction.

                  <p>Corruption, particularly bribery of government officials, inflicts substantial damage on people, society, and the world, and warrants control. Collective efforts to control corruption tend to focus on rules and compliance with those rules. This paper suggests that collective action also consider the creation of strong ethical cultures in business firms. Implementation of such programs is impeded by the difficulty in prescribing a course of action and by the difficulty in measuring the strength of an ethical culture. This paper suggests the measurement and maximization of stakeholder trust as a proxy for measures of ethical culture. The qualities that engender stakeholder trust correspond with ethical behaviors. Stakeholder trust confers benefits on business firms, which will incentivize and justify its measurement. Implementation of a program focused on ethical culture would benefit from collective action both by normalizing behaviors and in the development of sophisticated measurement tools.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10611-017-9767-2","2018-01-04 22:30:22","68","Crime, Law and Social Change"

                  <p>The local community represents a context in which a real quality of social life can be researched. One of the life quality indicators is a degree of satisfying security needs of citizens. Among the resources which the local community engages to solve these needs, the police occupy the key position. Within the model of police engagement in the local community, the concept of <em>community policing</em> has great significance as a qualitatively new system of the police organization and functioning based on the correlation between the citizens&rsquo; expectations and what the police really do. By interviewing 750 respondents in five communities in Serbia, in which this policing strategy is being realized, their security needs are being determined. The research results indicate that the citizens of the researched communities are concerned about the extent and intensity of the different forms of violence and all forms of social behavior which jeopardize the security of their families. They recognize the police as a local community resource in charge of solving their security needs and they point out the necessity of undertaking preventive activities. The following factors are noticed as the limitation factors: lack of interdepartmental cooperation within the police services and insufficient local community involvement in problem solving.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10610-017-9366-x","2018-01-05 01:30:43","83","European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research"

                  <p>Of all the advocacy services provided to partner violence and sexual assault victims, safety planning may be most central. However, unlike many community behavioral health or case management services, there is virtually no literature on standards of care in safety planning, ways to measure its effectiveness, or discussion of the challenges advocates face in their day-to-day practice of planning for victim safety. The purpose of this paper is to describe advocate perceptions of training and supervision, how they obtain feedback about their work with victims, and their personal challenges in safety planning with victims. Study results highlight the need for more guidance, training, and support as well as more coping strategies for the numerous personal challenges advocates face in their day-to-day safety planning work.

Because the relevant literature suggests that target selection and the places where terrorist attacks occur are related to a group&rsquo;s strategies, we also investigate whether and how violent terrorist acts vary with respect to their surroundings in the same jurisdiction when the ideology is the point of comparison. Separatist and leftist terrorist groups committed 1152 violent terrorist acts between 2008 and 2012 in Istanbul, Turkey. Our analysis begins with a comparison of targets and risk factors by the ideology of the perpetrators for 857 separatist and 295 leftist terrorist incidents. After identifying high-risk locations, we test the predictive validity of risk terrain modeling. The study results showed that context and spatial influence&mdash;the risky areas of terrorism&mdash;vary by the nature of the ideology in the jurisdiction. Practical implications also are discussed.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10610-017-9368-8","2018-01-06 05:45:38","337","European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research"
"8915","Self-Regulatory Investments Among Private Actors in the Era of Regulatory Capitalism: the Licensing of Swedish Finance and Securities Industry Employees","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>This article analyses the growth of the Swedish finance and securities industry&rsquo;s employee licensing programme to advance our understanding of the growth, conditions, and function of various forms of self-regulation in the era of regulatory capitalism. It examines how the situations that are significant for private actors&rsquo; initiation and implementation of self-regulation are connected with the development of a particular form of self-regulation. The article argues that the licensing programme in question is an example of self-regulation characterized by impersonal trust, identity assurance, and integrity. This type of self-regulation is related to the conditions that characterized the finance and securities industry before and at the time of the initiative and its implementation, in particular, economic confidence, normalization and expansion, and increasing complexity and heterogeneity. The article is based mainly on document analysis and market statistics supplemented with interviews.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10611-017-9766-3","2018-01-06 09:30:22","55","Crime, Law and Social Change"

Analysis of these data identified conflicts between the dominant understanding of trafficking and the group of people ultimately convicted for this activity. It is argued that there is a need to contextualise the response to this group with knowledge of their backgrounds often including the structural barriers experienced through migration. Developing an awareness of these offending pathways is important in understanding the nexus between the movement and exploitation of victims and the structures that control access to employment and income as well as for developing effective interventions for those involved in these offences.","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1111%2Fhojo.12241","2018-01-08 15:00:50","35","Howard Journal of Criminal Justice"
"8926","Criminal Career Dimensions of Juvenile- and Adult-Onset Offenders","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Purpose</h3>
                    <p>Earlier studies tried to predict and explain adult-onset offending, most often by comparing risk factors for juvenile and adult onset of criminal behavior. Little is known, however, about how criminal careers of adult-onset offenders develop. The aim of this study is to describe and compare juvenile- and adult-onset criminal careers of both men and women in terms of frequency, intensity, duration, recidivism, crime mix, seriousness, and specialization.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>Using a sample of 43,338 offenders who all had a criminal record in 2013, criminal careers are reconstructed retrospectively up to age 12 and prospectively up to the 1st of July, 2014. Male and female juvenile- and adult-onset offenders are identified and compared on the abovementioned parameters of their criminal careers.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>Compared to all other groups, female adult-onset offenders commit fewer crimes, offend at a lower rate, desist from crime earlier, have lower recidivism risks at least up to the tenth crime, commit different types of offenses, commit more minor and less serious crimes, and are more specialized in the types of crime they commit. Male juvenile-onset offenders have the most serious career in terms of these career dimensions.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>Criminal careers of adult-onset offenders, both men and women, develop differently on all dimensions. Implications for life-course criminological theories and prevention strategies are discussed.</p>

Research data was acquired through open-ended qualitative interviews conducted with a sample of 34 clergy in a broader study of clerical culture, <italic>habitus</italic> and life amidst the &lsquo;church abuse crisis&rsquo;. The framework of Situational Crime Prevention is employed to evaluate the feasibility of clergy&rsquo;s child-safe practices and comment on how these practices could be further altered through professional development.

Despite the fact that parents in numerous countries apply violent discipline methods to control children&rsquo;s behavior, little is known about the prevalence of maltreatment and violent discipline in Sub-Saharan Africa. In this study, we examined the prevalence of maltreatment and violent discipline from both the adolescents&rsquo; and parents&rsquo; perspectives. In addition, we explored risk factors that could be associated with violent discipline by parents. We administered questionnaires to a nationally representative sample of 700 Tanzanian secondary school students (52% girls, mean age: 14.92 years, SD&#8239;=&#8239;1.02, range: 12&ndash;17) and 333 parents or primary guardians (53% females; mean age: of 43.47 years, SD&#8239;=&#8239;9.02, range: 19&ndash;71). More than 90% of all students reported exposure to violent discipline by a parent within the past year. Concurrently, more than 80% of parents acknowledged using violent discipline techniques. Using a path model, we found that violent discipline by parents was associated with parental stress. Other risk factors contributed to a higher stress level but were not directly linked to maltreatment. Our findings indicate high levels of violent discipline in Tanzanian families. There is a pressing need to design and implement interventions that prevent children from experiencing violence at home. Reducing parents&rsquo; stress levels may be a starting point for intervention. Yet, due to the high levels of violent discipline, societal beliefs also need to be considered.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213418300127%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Da4f819e1e8faa5857074dc474db615d7","2018-01-09 12:00:18","45","Child Abuse and Neglect"

                  <p>Although immigrants tend to be less involved in crime than the native-born, less is known about whether immigration is protective regarding family violence and, if so, why. This is especially problematic given that some cultural features of immigrants, such as machismo, may increase family violence. Using a random sample of adults in El Paso County, Texas, the present study finds that family violence is substantially lower among first generation Mexican immigrants compared to 1.5 generation immigrants, second generation Americans and third generation or higher Americans. Higher levels of acculturation to Mexico among first generation immigrants partially mediated, or explained, this finding. However, familism and machismo were not higher among first generation Mexican immigrants; and, while lower among first generation immigrants, acculturation to the US was not associated with higher levels of family violence. Implications of these findings are discussed.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-017-9947-y","2018-01-10 08:31:10","67","Journal of Family Violence"
"8949","Detecting Deception Through Small Talk and Comparable Truth Baselines","The present experiment investigates similarities in participants' nonverbal and verbal behaviours when responding to baseline and investigative questions, comparing two different types of baselines. Police literature suggests to obtain a baseline through small talk, whereas academic literature underlines the importance of baseline and investigative themes to be comparable. First, a baseline was obtained (either small talk or comparable), then the investigative questioning started. During the investigative questioning, participants either truthfully reported a set of actions they had actually performed or lied about them. Findings revealed that truth tellers and liars in the small talk condition did not differ in their level of similarity when responding to the baseline and investigative questions. In the comparable truth condition, levels of verbal similarity between the baseline and investigative questions were higher for truth tellers than for liars, but only for one variable: spatial detail. Results therefore showed that a small talk baseline should not be used to assess interviewees' credibility, and that a comparable truth baseline, although better than a small talk baseline, is still problematic.","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fjip.1495","2018-01-10 12:01:49","73","Journal of Investigative Psychology and Offender Profiling"
"8950","Solving the Puzzle: the Effects of Contextual Information and Feedback on the Interpretation of A Crime Scene","In this study, we examined how the provision of contextual information and the ability to ask questions and obtain feedback affected mock investigators' interpretation of a crime scene. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 conditions in a 2Â Ã—Â 2 design and assessed two photographs of the same crime scene. Participants were instructed to write a narrative about what they thought had happened at the scene. Results showed that the provision of contextual information and the ability to ask questions had no effect on the lengths of the narratives participants produced. However, participants who received contextual information wrote a more factual narrative containing more descriptions of actions before, during, and after the crime. Across all conditions, most of the questions were asked about persons who could in some way be involved in the crime. Results of this study indicate that the provision of contextual information helped participants to focus on the more factual, rather than speculative elements, of the crime.","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fjip.1494","2018-01-10 12:01:49","54","Journal of Investigative Psychology and Offender Profiling"

"8954","Effect of Emergency Winter Homeless Shelters on Property Crime","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Objective</h3>
                    <p>To evaluate the effect of emergency winter homeless shelters on property crimes in the nearby communities.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>Every winter between 2009 and 2016, the City of Vancouver, Canada opened shelters to protect the homeless from harsh winter conditions. The city opened 19 shelters, but only five to nine of them were open in any one winter. Using the variation in timing and placement of the shelters, we contrast crime rates in the surrounding areas when the shelters are open and closed.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>The presence of a shelter appears to cause property crime to increase by 56% within 100&nbsp;m of that shelter, with thefts from vehicles, other thefts, and vandalism driving the increase. However, when a homeless shelter opened, rates of breaking and entering commercial establishments were 34% lower within 100&nbsp;m of that shelter. The observed effects are concentrated close to shelters, within 400&nbsp;m, and dissipate beyond 400&nbsp;m. Consistent with a causal effect, we find a decreasing effect of shelters with increasing distance from the shelter.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>While homeless shelters are a critical social service, in Vancouver, they appear to impact property crime in the surrounding community. Shelters may warrant greater security to control property crime, but the data suggest that any increase in security need not extend beyond 400&nbsp;m, about two to three blocks, from the shelters.</p>

"8955","Parental Imprisonment and Premature Mortality in Adulthood","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Purpose</h3>
                    <p>Rising prison populations worldwide have led to an increasing body of research about the well-being of children of prisoners. Research to date has demonstrated that the consequences of parental imprisonment for children are significant and long lasting, often extending beyond the imprisonment period and into adulthood. However, research examining the association between parental imprisonment and offspring health problems and mortality is lacking. Moreover, no research to date has examined the association between parental imprisonment and premature mortality among adults.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>Using a Dutch multigenerational sample, this study aimed to extend existing literature by examining the link between parental imprisonment and offspring mortality up to age 65, while controlling for parental criminality.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>Results indicated that children of imprisoned parents were significantly more likely to die prematurely than children of both non-criminal and criminal but non-imprisoned parents.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>These findings implicate that the mortality risk is not the consequence of the parental criminal behavior but is specifically related to the incarceration of the parent. Further research is required to examine the mechanisms at play for the increased risk of premature mortality for children of prisoners. This research has important implications for health-related early interventions and criminal justice policy.</p>

                  <p>The present study examines the association between employment and offending for a sample of young offenders who are paid to work in a pilot programme known as the Skill Mill. First, we analyse a sample of 39 youths over a period of 10&nbsp;years (40 quarters) to determine whether Skill Mill employed youth are more likely to desist from offending than a control group of youth who are not employed in the Skill Mill. Those youths employed by the Skill Mill committed 1.12 fewer offences per quarter than the control group (<em>p</em>&thinsp;&lt;&thinsp;0.001). In addition, offending rates among the Skill Mill youths decreased by 0.99 offences per quarter after they began work (<em>p</em>&thinsp;&lt;&thinsp;0.001). Next, we review results from semi-structured interviews with current Skill Mill employees and their supervisor that helps to unpack why the Skill Mill has been successful in promoting desistance. We conclude that programmes like the Skill Mill can mark an important turning point, and more specifically, a hook for change in the lives of young offenders.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10610-017-9365-y","2018-01-11 16:30:58","40","European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research"

                  <p>The following case study concerns the period in which Carlos Vielman, a well-heeled Guatemalan businessman from a prominent family, became the interior minister of the &Oacute;scar Berger administration. While minister, Vielman oversaw the creation of several special units that &ldquo;acted as an organized crime group,&rdquo; according to Guatemalan and international investigators. He, along with several of his police deputies were eventually charged for murder. He was later exonerated by a court in Spain, while others were prosecuted. This case study delves into that period, exploring how Vielman&rsquo;s ministry represented an extension of the Guatemalan elite&rsquo;s approach towards security and the government writ large to thwart rivals, regardless of the violent and criminal consequences.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10611-017-9762-7","2018-01-12 04:16:06","63","Crime, Law and Social Change"
"8965","Exploring the Delivery of Officer Safety Training: A Case Study","<span><div>Abstract</div>The training of police arrest and self-defence skills (ASDS), known as officer safety training (OST) in the UK, is assumed to produce highly skilled practitioners in the use of force. However, little is known about the nature and effectiveness of such training. The purpose of this study was to provide evidence concerning the structure and organization of OST, to begin a discussion about the effectiveness of training and to open up avenues for the development of training. Data were collected using a case study approach utilizing participant observation, interviews, and time-on-task analysis. Data suggested instructor-centric training based on behavioural education ideology where officers spent at least 50% of the time passive. Practice activities were organized without an agreed or consistent strategy that produced a curriculum delivered in a disjointed fashion resulting in unrealistic training that had limited officer engagement. The training also highlighted issues related to women officers with a &lsquo;hidden curriculum&rsquo; reinforcing notions of women officers as different, inferior and objectified. The findings highlight a need to maximize practice time-on-task, which includes reality-based practice under pressure, and to review instructor-training provision, to ensure that instructors and those responsible for training are abreast of the latest developments in the training of ASDS, and more innovative pedagogy for the delivery of such training.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pax095/4803079?rss=1","2018-01-12 10:01:35","47","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"

Four main areas of interest can be identified where neurobiology plays or could play a role: (1) criminological research focused on understanding criminal behavior, (2) the (early) detection/prediction of and intervention in deviant behavior, (3) criminal proceedings: to assess responsibility and inform sentencing, and (4) forensic rehabilitation and treatment settings.

"9076","Learning to Blast A Way Into Crime, Or Just Good Clean Fun? Examining Aggressive Play With Toy Weapons and Its Relation With Crime","Background
Researchers, such as Bandura, have proposed that children's mere exposure to the use of play weapons encourages deviant displays of aggression, but there is very little research to support this hypothesis of 20Â years.


Aim
To examine the relationship between amount of weapon play and concurrent aggression as well as later violent juvenile crime, while controlling for other variables possibly influencing criminal pathways.


Method
Using longitudinal survey data collected from mothers and children (nÂ =Â 2019) from age 5, with follow-up at age 15, correlations between children's play with toy weapons and juvenile criminality were examined. Multivariate regression analyses were employed to determine to what extent early childhood aggression, symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and symptoms of depression were antecedents of juvenile crime.


Results
For bivariate analysis between toy weapon play and juvenile criminality, the effect size was small and not significant. The relationship remained not significant once control variables were introduced into the model.


Conclusions and implications
The act of pretending to be aggressive in childhood thus plays little role in predicting later criminality after other factors, such as gender, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or depression, have been taken into account. Involvement in imaginative play with toy gun use in early childhood is unlikely to be useful as a risk marker for later criminal behaviour. Play fighting and war toy games may even be considered necessary components within the frame of normal development.

"9077","Age Onset of Offending and Serious Mental Illness Among Forensic Psychiatric Patients: A Latent Profile Analysis","Background
Developmental typologies regarding age of onset of violence and offending have not routinely taken account of the role of serious mental illness (SMI), and whether age of onset of offending in relation to onset of illness impacts on the manifestation of offending over the life course.


Aims
To test whether forensic psychiatric patients can be classified according to age of onset of SMI and offending, and, if so, whether subtypes differ by sex.


Methods
Details of all 511 patients enrolled into a large forensic mental health service in Ontario, Canada, in 2011 or 2012 were collected from records.


Results
A latent profile analysis supported a 2-class solution in both men and women. External validation of the classes demonstrated that those with a younger age onset of serious mental illness and offending were characterised by higher levels of static risk factors and criminogenic need than those whose involvement in both mental health and criminal justice systems was delayed to later life.


Conclusions
Our findings present a new perspective on life course trajectories of offenders with SMI. While analyses identified just two distinct age-of-onset groups, in both the illness preceded the offending. The fact that our sample was entirely drawn from those hospitalised may have introduced a selection bias for those whose illness precedes offending, but findings underscore the complexity and level of need among those with a younger age of onset.

"9078","An Examination of the Interaction Between Morality and Self-Control in Offending: A Study of Differences Between Girls and Boys","Background
There is a well-documented gender difference in offending, with evidence that boys, on average, are more involved in crime than girls. Opinions differ, however, on whether the causes of crime apply to girls and boys similarly.


Aims
Our aim is to explore crime propensity in boys and girls. Our research questions were (1) are there differences between boys and girls in moral values and self-control; (2) are these attributes similarly correlated with offending among girls and boys; and (3) is any interaction effect between morality and self-control identical for girls and boys.


Methods
Data were drawn from the MalmÃ¶ Individual and Neighbourhood Development Study, which includes 481 girls and boys aged 16â€“17. An 8-item self-control scale was derived from Grasmick's self-control instrument; we created a 16-item morality scale. Analysis of variance was used to test for differences in scale scores.


Results
There were significant gender differences in moral values but not self-control. Moral values and self-control were significantly correlated with offending among both girls and boys. In the multiple regression analysis, the three-way interaction term used to test the interaction between gender, self-control and moral values was non-significant, indicating that the magnitude of the self-controlâ€“moral value interaction is not affected by gender.


Conclusions
Our findings indicate that effects of morality and self-control are general and apply to girls and boys similarly, so more research is needed to explain gender differences in crime prevalence.

                  <p>The contemporary policing literature contains numerous examples of partnerships between academic researchers and police agencies. Such efforts have greatly contributed to evidence-based policing by increasing the knowledge base on effective strategies. However, research has demonstrated that successful collaboration between researchers and practitioners can be a challenge, with various organizational and inter-agency factors presenting difficulties at various stages of the process. Additionally, applied research can oftentimes face implementation challenges when the time comes to convert research into practice. The current study contributes to the literature by discussing researcher/practitioner partnerships and program implementation in the context of a multi-city risk-based policing project in the United States. We conceptualize police interventions as contingent on four distinct phases: 1) problem analysis, 2) project design, 3) project implementation, and 4) project evaluation. In this project, the research partners were able to successfully complete each phase in certain cities while the project experienced difficulty at one or more phases in other cities. We discuss these disparate experiences, identifying factors that facilitate or impede successful completion of each step. Policy implications and recommendations for future risk-based policing interventions are discussed.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10610-017-9367-9","2018-01-16 10:30:28","58","European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research"

                  <p>
      In 2009, a large-scale construction project on rivers and riparian zones in South Korea, which is called the Four Major Rivers Restoration Project, was launched. The officially announced purposes of this project included: (1) solving water shortages, (2) improving water quality, and (3) providing citizens with leisure facilities. However, adverse environmental consequences such as deterioration of water quality, mass death of aquatic life, and soil contamination have been consistently reported. The current study focuses on illuminating South Korean political economy contexts and analyzing stakeholders&rsquo; political and/or economic interests that shaped the project. We conclude that reinforced neoliberalism in South Korea after the Asian financial crisis in 1997 should be considered to understand the background of this project. Within the neoliberal contexts, we also argue that political and economic interests of three stakeholders&mdash;business, the state, and the public&mdash;were closely associated with the implementation of this project.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10612-018-9384-0","2018-01-17 09:30:26","57","Critical Criminology"

Although establishing child maltreatment as a causal mechanism for adult economic outcomes is fraught with difficulty, understanding the relationship between the two is essential to reducing such inequality. This paper presents findings from a systematic review of longitudinal research examining experiences of child maltreatment and economic outcomes in adulthood. A systematic search of seven databases found twelve eligible retrospective and prospective cohort studies. From the available evidence, there was a relatively clear relationship between &lsquo;child maltreatment&rsquo; and poorer economic outcomes such as reduced income, unemployment, lower level of job skill and fewer assets, over and above the influence of family of origin socio-economic status. Despite an extremely limited evidence base, neglect had a consistent relationship with a number of long-term economic outcomes, while physical abuse has a more consistent relationship with income and employment. Studies examining sexual abuse found less of an association with income and employment, although they did find a relationship other outcomes such as sickness absence, assets, welfare receipt and financial insecurity. Nonetheless, all twelve studies showed some association between at least one maltreatment type and at least one economic measure. The task for future research is to clarify the relationship between specific maltreatment types and specific economic outcomes, taking account of how this may be influenced by gender and life course stage.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213417304817%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D4030ec1f3b5e9ab4cea9407efaf5638d","2018-01-18 16:00:16","78","Child Abuse and Neglect"

Parents of children between the ages of 3&ndash;11 years were randomly assigned to the intervention (watching the <italic>Second Step</italic> videos) or the control (watching videos on child obesity) groups. They completed measures assessing their knowledge of child sexual abuse (CSA), motivation to discuss CSA, self-reported discussions of CSA, child history of victimization, parent exposure to CSA, and comparable measures on topics of health and nutrition at pre-test. Participants viewed the videos one week later and immediately completed post-test 1, and then two months later completed the measures again. Multivariate Analyses of Covariance (MANCOVAs) and serial mediation analyses were conducted with the final sample of 438. The intervention group, compared to the control group, had significant increases in knowledge (specifically, less restrictive stereotype beliefs about CSA) and motivation to talk with their children about CSA both immediately after the intervention and at the two-month follow-up. Although the intervention did not have a direct effect on parent self-reported conversations with their children about CSA, it had a mediated effect. The intervention increased knowledge regarding CSA, which then predicted motivation, which in turn predicted conversations.

To address the limitations of some existing scholarship, the current study examines the moderating effects of IQ on the association between key criminological constructs and antisocial behavior.</simple-para></abstract-sec><abstract-sec ns2=""http://webservices.elsevier.com/schemas/search/fast/types/v4"" soapenv=""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"" view=""all""><section-title>Methods</section-title><simple-para view=""all"">Using the restricted available Add Health data (<italic>N</italic><hsp sp=""0.25""></hsp>=<hsp sp=""0.25""></hsp>1102&ndash;3556), the current study conducted 48 regression analyses (44 OLS and four binary logistic regression analyses) moderated by IQ, wherein antisocial behavior was regressed on peer drug use, maternal conflict, paternal conflict, maternal involvement, paternal involvement, parental supervision, neighborhood disadvantage, school attachment, and social support on antisocial behavior.</simple-para></abstract-sec><abstract-sec ns2=""http://webservices.elsevier.com/schemas/search/fast/types/v4"" soapenv=""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"" view=""all""><section-title>Results</section-title><simple-para view=""all"">The findings provided evidence suggesting that IQ moderated the effects of key criminological constructs on antisocial behavior such as peer drug use and neighborhood disadvantage.

"9088","Bitcoin, Crypto-Coins, and Global Anti-Money Laundering Governance","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>Crypto-coins (CCs) like Bitcoin are digitally encrypted tokens traded in peer-to-peer networks whose money laundering potential has attracted the attention of regulators, firms and the wider public worldwide. This article assesses the effectiveness of the global anti-money laundering regime in balancing both the challenges and opportunities presented by these novel &lsquo;altcoins&rsquo;. Two main arguments are advanced. First, the implications that crypto-coins presently pose for global anti-money laundering efforts stem less from the threats of their illicit uses as digital <em>currencies</em> and more from the opportunities presented by their underlying blockchain <em>technologies</em>. Second, despite several shortcomings, the risk-based approach pursued by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) strikes an effective balance between the existing threats and opportunities that crypto-coins currently present. Rather than a conclusive evaluation however this article stresses the need for continual monitoring and investigation of the wider ethical implications raised by CCs for global efforts to combat money laundering in an era of rapid technological change.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10611-017-9756-5","2018-01-19 06:00:21","91","Crime, Law and Social Change"

                  <p>Drawing on Raewyn Connell&rsquo;s <em>Southern Theory</em> (<span>2007</span>), Carrington et al. (British Journal of Criminology, 56(1), 1&ndash;20, <span>2015</span>) have called for a de-colonization and democratization of criminological knowledge, which, they argue, has privileged the epistemologies of the global North. Taking up the challenge of &ldquo;southern criminology,&rdquo; in this paper we examine the concept of race as a political artifact of northern thinking. The idea of race is durable in criminology. To illustrate this, we examine the racialization of Aboriginal Australians. Given the relationship between processes of racialization and criminalization, criminology should avoid engaging in practices which produce or reinforce racial schema. Further, with reference to southern epistemologies, we offer an alternative construct of human difference and diversity grounded in discourses of belonging specific to Australasian cultures.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11417-017-9263-8","2018-01-19 07:30:16","129","Asian Journal of Criminology"
"9090","A More Nordic Norway? Examining Prisons in 21st Century Iceland","This article seeks to examine the exact status of Iceland in light of the Nordic penal exceptionalism thesis. This thesis considers that punishment in the Nordic countries is fundamentally more benign than that in Anglophone countries (Pratt 2008a, 2008b). Yet from this perspective the remote Nordic country of Iceland remains overlooked. That is unfortunate as, at first sight, there is much to be intrigued about: Iceland's prison rate is very low; Iceland is small and homogeneous which may offer cultural or structural pre-conditions for a positive penal system. Its penal estate is tiny with a small number of very small prisons. In addition, Iceland has a history of low crime rates and a tradition of lenient sentencing practices. All this makes it interesting to consider whether the penal exceptionalism thesis (Pratt and Eriksson 2011) actually extends to Iceland. To what extent does Iceland fit the Nordic mould of penal practice?","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1111%2Fhojo.12244","2018-01-19 13:00:29","48","Howard Journal of Criminal Justice"
"9091","Policing Intimate Partner Violence: the â€˜golden Threadâ€™ of Discretion","<span><div>Abstract</div>This paper offers a critical appreciation of pro-arrest-positive policing policies towards intimate partner violence (IPV). It examines the extent to which such policies, and the research associated with them, have operated within a partial understanding of discretion, which has paid detailed attention to the response of the front-line officer and how that response might be changed either by improved training and/or by rule tightening. Such approaches assume that policing IPV is separate and separable from policing other forms of violence(s) and fail to recognize the wider context of the policing task. This paper makes the case for a more holistic understanding of discretion (to include senior officers) as a way of promoting improved responses to IPV. This also means directing attention to policies and practices in relation to IPV to include police engagement with broader agency and societal responses to IPV. This is the point at which a holistic &lsquo;golden thread&rsquo; of discretion can be found.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay001/4818103?rss=1","2018-01-20 04:00:46","162","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"

The current study investigated the role of maternal PTSD symptoms and parenting strategies in the relationship between mothers&rsquo; IPV experiences and psychopathology in their young children, ages 3&ndash;6 years in a community-based cohort of 308 mother-child dyads at high risk for family violence. Data were collected from 2011 to 2014. IPV history and maternal PTSD symptoms were assessed by self-report questionnaires. Children&rsquo;s symptoms were assessed with a developmentally-sensitive psychiatric interview administered to mothers. Punitive/restrictive parenting was independently-coded from in-depth interviews with mothers about their disciplinary practices. Hypothesized direct and indirect pathways between physical and psychological IPV, maternal PTSD, maternal parenting style, and children&rsquo;s internalizing and externalizing symptoms were examined with mediation models. Results indicated that neither physical nor psychological IPV experienced by mothers was directly associated with children&rsquo;s symptoms. However, both types of victimization were associated with maternal PTSD symptoms. Examination of indirect pathways suggested that maternal PTSD symptoms mediated the relationship between mothers&rsquo; psychological and physical IPV experiences and children&rsquo;s internalizing and externalizing symptoms and mothers&rsquo; restrictive/punitive parenting mediated the relationship between mothers&rsquo; psychological IPV and children&rsquo;s externalizing symptoms. In addition, there was a path from maternal physical IPV to child externalizing symptoms through both maternal PTSD symptoms and restrictive/punitive parenting. Findings highlight the importance of supporting parents in recovering from the sequelae of their own traumatic experiences, as their ensuing mental health symptoms and parenting behaviors may have a significant impact on their children&rsquo;s emotional health.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS014521341830022X%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D82330782e16939e6fe573851c123dbf2","2018-01-20 16:00:18","41","Child Abuse and Neglect"

                  <span>
                    <h3>Objectives</h3>
                    <p>This research, using focal concerns perspective on sentencing, examines how and why psychiatric labels, and having diagnoses biologically &ldquo;labeled,&rdquo; affect sentencing beliefs. Dimensions of public stigma toward psychiatric illnesses are hypothesized to mediate sentencing views.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>This is a 2&thinsp;&times;&thinsp;2 partially-crossed, between-subjects multifactorial experiment with a lay sample (<em>n</em>=&thinsp;1213), presenting mediation analyses.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>Four psychiatric labels (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, behavioral-variant Frontotemporal Dementia, High Functioning Autism, Borderline Intellectual Disability) led to significant beneficial effects on sentencing (less prison/rehabilitation support) as mediated by decreased stigmatization regarding lack of treatability, social acceptance, and personal responsibility. One biological &ldquo;label&rdquo; (Pedophilic Disorder) was mediated by decreased stigmatization (dangerousness), resulting in less prison support.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>Data support effects of psychiatric labeling on sentencing under focal concerns. As no psychiatric labels resulted in <em>increased</em> discriminatory sentencing and, instead, led to <em>decreased</em> discriminatory sentencing behavior, psychiatric labeling may reduce punitiveness and bolster non-punitive sentencing beliefs. Biological labeling, aside from Pedophilic Disorder, may not affect sentencing.</p>

"9123","Studying Crime Trends: Normal Science and Exogenous Shocks","The study of crime trends has proceeded along two paths: 1) normal science investigations of slow-moving and tractable changes in crime rates and explanatory conditions and 2) research encounters with unexpected and abrupt changes in crime rates resulting from exogenous shocks. I draw from my research on the relationship between crime rates and changing macroeconomic conditions to illustrate the pains and pleasures of studying crime trends with the tools of normal science. I describe my exploratory investigations of the recent homicide rise in the United States to underscore the theoretical importance and methodological challenges of research on exogenous shocks to crime rates. Finally, I hope to convey to the next generation of criminologists the intellectual excitement that comes from the study of crime trends.","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1111%2F1745-9125.12170","2018-01-23 12:00:41","198","Criminology"
"9124","Do White-Collar Offenders Find Prison More Punitive Than Property Offenders","Journal of Financial Crime, Volume 25, Issue 1, Page 230-243, January 2018. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose The purpose of this paper is to use exchange rate theory to compare how white-collar offenders and property offenders rank the severity of various correctional sanctions.   Design/methodology/approach The authors use survey data from 160 inmates incarcerated for white-collar and property crimes in a Midwestern state to compare how white-collar inmates differed from property inmates in ranking the goals of prison and the punitiveness of prison as compared to other alternatives.   Findings White-collar offenders were no different than property offenders in terms of their assessment of the punitiveness of prison compared to the punitiveness of the four sanctions under consideration here. White-collar offenders were significantly more likely than property offenders to believe that the goal of prison is to rehabilitate rather than deter individuals from further crime.   Research limitations/implications Because the authors defined white-collar offenders by their crime of incarceration, they may have captured offenders who are not truly white-collar offenders. Focusing on offenders who were in prison did not allow them to fully examine whether similarities between white-collar and property offenders can be attributed to adjustment to prison or some other variable.   Practical implications Alternative sanctions may be useful in punishing white-collar offenders in a less expensive manner than prison. Results suggest white-collar offenders may be more amenable to rehabilitation than property offenders and may not experience prison much differently than other types of offenders.   Originality value This research is important because it is the first of its kind to compare white-collar offendersâ€™ views about the punitiveness of prison and the goals of incarceration with those of property offenders.","http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-11-2016-0073?af=R","2018-01-23 12:16:22","67","Journal of Financial Crime"
"9125","Can â€œHarmonizationâ€ Antidote Tax Avoidance and Other Financial Crimes Globally?","Journal of Financial Crime, Volume 25, Issue 1, Page 187-209, January 2018. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose The purpose of this research paper is to underscore that harmonization of laws, much as it might not offer a lasting cure of tax avoidance and other forms of financial crimes, can enhance the fight against it and subsequently help to forestall it. Tax avoidance has remained an intractable challenge and costs governments astronomical sums of money, largely because taxation is a sensitive issue in the realm of sovereign national jurisdictions. The first part of this paper involves a review of empirical data on tax avoidance to create a context for evaluating theoretical issues on tax avoidance and how they are manifested in practice. It draws examples in a cross-jurisdictional perspective given the global character of tax avoidance and evasion as financial crimes. The last part of this paper discusses possible recommendations that could be implemented to tackle tax avoidance and its attendant challenges on economies.   Design/methodology/approach The author has carried out a scoping review of the literature on tax avoidance and myriad of ways used to commit it globally. There was a wealth of data on tax avoidance, evasion, money laundering and harmonization of laws, which was reviewed and applied in undertaking this study. These data were sourced from published academic books, journal articles and online data sources/websites. This paper reflects on and internalizes most recent empirical data on tax avoidance and evasion such as unprecedented leak of millions of files from the database of the worldâ€™s fourth biggest offshore law firm, Mossack Fonseca â€“ the so-called â€œPanama papersâ€, which has revealed the extent of tax avoidance globally. It also goes an extra length (literally speaking) to underscore important measures that ought to be introduced to address tax avoidance, evasion and money laundering once and for all.   Findings The findings of this paper confirm that while harmonization of law has its inherent shortcomings, it is necessary to enhance individual stateâ€™s ability to deal with overlapping interstate challenges such as tax avoidance. This paper proffers a thorough analysis of tax avoidance, the varied context in which it is manifested with a view to evaluate measures that could be adopted by states to minimize or forestall it globally.   Research limitations/implications This paper has used data on tax avoidance and cognate areas in underscoring inherent challenges in current measures against tax avoidance globally. There were not many studies carried out on the role of harmonization in bolstering statesâ€™ efforts against tax avoidance and other financial crimes.   Practical implications Paying taxes or avoiding paying it has a direct bearing on people, societies and national governments. It is therefore important that states adopt measures to curtail tax avoidance â€“ because it costs governments a lot of revenue.   Originality/value Though studies have been conducted on tax avoidance and cognate areas, this paper articulates that harmonization could greatly enhance the fight against it globally. This paper will appeal to tax authorities, banks, governments, policy makers, oversight financial institutions and those who have a vested interest in regulation of financial crimes globally.","http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-06-2016-0045?af=R","2018-01-23 12:16:23","66","Journal of Financial Crime"
"9126","Strengthening the Effectiveness of Whistleblowing System","Journal of Financial Crime, Volume 25, Issue 1, Page 140-154, January 2018. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose The purpose of this paper is to identify and map out various aspects and key elements, which are necessary to strengthen an effective and systematic whistleblowing system (WBS) and ensure adequate protection in accordance with the characteristics typical of Indonesia.   Design/methodology/approach This research emphasizes the extensive use of literature review and previous research that analyze whistleblowing as an issue and ethical challenge in public institutions. This research also reviews documents pertaining to the formulation and implementation of existing WBS. Additionally, this research also analyzes some cases experienced by a number of whistleblower figures in Indonesia as a contribution and recommendation to parties interested in formulating a more effective and systematic WBS.   Findings An effective and systematic WBS, assuring adequate protection, needs a number of key elements which will be identified and mapped out in this research and, subsequently, categorized into several aspects covering human and ethical culture; policy; legal protection; organizational structure; and procedures and process in accordance to Indonesiaâ€™s specific characteristics.   Practical implications The paper can be a source to explore anti-corruption policy and the prevention approach of corruption based on Indonesian perspectives.   Originality/value This paper is a significant undertaking aimed at raising public trust in public institutions and providing adequate protection to whistleblowers. It also contributes by encouraging the public organization to prevent corruption and other wrongdoing, which, nowadays, are common in Indonesia.","http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-11-2016-0069?af=R","2018-01-23 12:16:23","55","Journal of Financial Crime"
"9127","Kleptocracy in Nigeria","Journal of Financial Crime, Volume 25, Issue 1, Page 57-69, January 2018. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose The purpose of this study is to sonographically explore kleptocracy in Nigeriaâ€™s nascent democracy and evaluate how democracy can mitigate kleptocratic behavior amongst Nigerian political elite for a positive social change using sonic therapeutic intervention lens.   Design/methodology/approach The author inductively generated data through document analysis in this qualitative study.   Findings The results of the study showed that kleptocracy has been an age-long politico-financial crime in Nigeria. The author proffered sonic therapeutic intervention to simultaneously enhance democratic values and mitigate kleptocracy among the Nigerian leaders.   Research limitations/implications The limitations of the study stemmed from the fact that it cannot be generalized.   Practical implications The practical implications of the study stemmed from the fact that any leader can take advantage of the research findings and apply the recommendations to themselves for personal transformation without incurring any costs.   Social implications The social implication of the study is rooted in the fact that if the Nigerian leadership implement the recommendation(s) of the study, there will be a positive social change in the country inasmuch as financial crime will be mitigated.   Originality/value The originality of the study stemmed from the fact that this inquiry filled the gap in financial crime literature and there was no such study ever conducted in the discipline.","http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-08-2016-0053?af=R","2018-01-23 12:16:23","43","Journal of Financial Crime"
"9128","Forgetting Corruption: Unlearning the Knowledge of Corruption in the Indonesian Public Sector","Journal of Financial Crime, Volume 25, Issue 1, Page 28-56, January 2018. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose Based on the authorsâ€™ study, the main purpose of this paper is to ascertain a systematic long-term solution for the corruption problem in the Indonesian public sector from the knowledge management perspective. To achieve its objectives, this paper applies multiple perspectives and theories of corruption and knowledge management on the corruption problem in Indonesia.   Design/methodology/approach This paper is based on the authorsâ€™ study to assess the corruption problem in the Indonesian public sector in the past decade through the examination of reports from various institutions and other relevant documents to highlight various behavioral issues in knowledge management in the Indonesian public sector and how they relate to corruption.   Findings The authors establish that a major factor behind corruptionâ€™s ability to regenerate over time in the Indonesian public sector is the fact that it has become part of knowledge conversion in Indonesian public institutions for so long that removing it would be a very challenging task. To remove corruption from Indonesian public institutions is to remove it from the existing knowledge conversion spiral within these institutions by means of organizational unlearning and re-learning. The primary focus of the unlearning and re-learning process should be to eliminate the knowledge of corruption, in both tacit and explicit forms, and replace it with the knowledge of good governance, accountability and integrity. Through systematic organizational unlearning and re-learning along with other more repressive measures, the risk of corruption in public institutions in Indonesia will gradually diminish over time.   Research limitations/implications This study is relying on documentary analysis to highlight the trend in behavioral problems in relation to knowledge conversion in the Indonesian public sector. Future studies should incorporate interviews with corruption offenders and local leaders to gain a more accurate view of how knowledge conversion plays its role in the growth and regeneration of corruption in the Indonesian public sector.   Practical implications This paper contributes to the development of corruption eradication strategy by proposing a framework for systematically removing corruption knowledge from an organization. With this, framework resources can be allocated more effectively and efficiently to achieve the objectives of corruption prevention.   Originality/value This paper highlights the importance of behavior-oriented approaches in mitigating corruption in the Indonesian public sector.","http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-07-2016-0048?af=R","2018-01-23 12:16:23","49","Journal of Financial Crime"
"9129","Bitcoin Transactions: A Digital Discovery of Illicit Activity on the Blockchain","Journal of Financial Crime, Volume 25, Issue 1, Page 109-130, January 2018. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose The purpose of this paper is to determine if Bitcoin transactions could be de-anonymised by analysing the Bitcoin blockchain and transactions conducted through the blockchain. In addition, graph analysis and the use of modern social media technology were examined to determine how they may help reveal the identity of Bitcoin users. A review of machine learning techniques and heuristics was carried out to learn how certain behaviours from the Bitcoin network could be augmented with social media technology and other data to identify illicit transactions.   Design/methodology/approach A number of experiments were conducted and time was spend observing the network to ascertain how Bitcoin transactions work, how the Bitcoin protocol operates over the network and what Bitcoin artefacts can be examined from a digital forensics perspective. Packet sniffing software, Wireshark, was used to see whether the identity of a user is revealed when they set up a wallet via an online wallet service. In addition, a block parser was used to analyse the Bitcoin client synchronisation and reveal information on the behaviour of a Bitcoin node when it joins the network and synchronises to the latest blockchain. The final experiment involved setting up and witnessing a transaction using the Bitcoin Client API. These experiments and observations were then used to design a proof of concept and functional software architecture for searching, indexing and analyzing publicly available data flowing from the blockchain and other big data sources.   Findings Using heuristics and graph analysis techniques show us that it is possible to build up a picture of behaviour of Bitcoin addresses and transactions, then utilise existing typologies of illicit behaviour to collect, process and exploit potential red flag indicators. Augmenting Bitcoin data, big data and social media may be used to reveal potentially illicit financial transaction going through the Bitcoin blockchain and machine learning applied to the data sets to rank and cluster suspicious transactions.   Originality/value The development of a functional software architecture that, in theory, could be used to detect suspicious illicit transactions on the Bitcoin network.","http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-12-2016-0078?af=R","2018-01-23 12:16:23","174","Journal of Financial Crime"
"9130","Report on the Debate Regarding EU Cash Payment Limitations","Journal of Financial Crime, Volume 25, Issue 1, Page 5-27, January 2018. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose Response to suggestion that EU-wide cash payment limits would assist in the control of terrorism finance and money laundering.   Design/methodology/approach Desk review and interviews   Findings The inception impact assessment (IIA) is ill-conceived, not grounded on firm empirical evidence and harmful to both crime control and the legitimate interests and rights of the EU citizens. The action under discussion is presented as a measure against terrorism finance, serious crime and tax evasion. The problem is that these criminal acts correspond to very different methods, volumes, perpetrators, causes and control challenges. Cash payment limitations (CPLs) are nowhere near a panacea that can address all of them and cannot make any of them go away magically. Even when each of these crime challenges are considered on their own, the empirical linkage of CPLs to effective controls is not there. The evidence from EU countries with CPLs in place shows higher levels of informal economy, corruption, tax evasion and terrorism risks than those without. There is substantial evidence of non-cash, very serious and organized crime, while the amounts needed and used by terrorists in Europe are usually very small in cash transactions, way below the thresholds under consideration. In fact, determined offenders will shift to other methods and become more sophisticated, posing new problems to controllers. Displacement and incentives for better-organized crime may well be the main products of such measures.   Originality/value It counters the argument that the cash payment limits can help reduce serious crime, while pointing to several adverse consequences on legitimate interests and human rights.","http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-06-2017-0058?af=R","2018-01-23 12:16:23","58","Journal of Financial Crime"
"9131","Differentiating Contract Killers: A Narrative-Based Approach","Previous attempts to determine contract killersâ€™ behaviour have not benefited from any formal psychological framework of behavioural distinction. The Narrative Action System model (NAS model; Canter and Youngs 2009) offers an empirical basis for differentiating contract killings and examining the psychological underpinnings of different contract killer styles. The model identifies four major narrative offender types: Professional, Revenger, Hero, and Victim. The present study aims to examine whether these themes can be applied to contract killing. Content analysis of 75 contract killer cases identified 56 crime scene actions. Data were subjected to a non-metric multidimensional scaling procedure, namely Smallest Space Analysis (SSA-I). Findings revealed four distinct types of contract killers that could be related to the four modes of offending proposed by the NAS model. Differences in the thematic structure of contract killing offences are discussed, and implications are offered for clinical and investigative purposes.","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1111%2Fhojo.12243","2018-01-23 14:31:04","57","Howard Journal of Criminal Justice"

"9198","Reflections on Rwandaâ€™s Approaches to Crime Related Asset Recovery","Journal of Financial Crime, Volume 25, Issue 1, Page 70-80, January 2018. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose In this paper, the author intends to showcase the effectiveness of the Rwandan legal regime governing criminal asset recovery. This paper aims to advocate for a need to enforce laws, which seems to be dormant, and to ensure fairness of action when confiscating or seizing assets that initially belongs to bonafide third parties.   Design/methodology/approach The author assesses the effectiveness of law No. 42/2014 of 27/01/2015 governing the recovery of offence-related assets in Rwanda and compares it with established international standards provided in major conventions to which Rwanda is a party. Primary and secondary sources of legal research have been used. Primary sources include international conventions, domestic laws and case laws. Secondary sources include books, chapters, journal articles and policy papers.   Findings In this paper, the author submits that the law on crime-related asset recovery suffers from strategic deficiencies and gaps and posits that the process of asset recovery should be streamlined and balanced to meet the aims of crime prevention.   Originality/value This research paper is a first of its kind. Through positive criticism, it showcases that Rwanda is doing well through the establishment of relevant laws to combat crime. However, it proposes solutions to identify gaps. This paper is original and has never been published anywhere else, and all sources used have duly been recognized.","http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-09-2016-0060?af=R","2018-01-24 12:01:26","88","Journal of Financial Crime"
"9199","Accountability of Senior Compliance Management For Compliance Failures in A Credit Institution","Journal of Financial Crime, Volume 25, Issue 1, Page 131-139, January 2018. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose In most industries, legal entities of a certain size and complexity must have a compliance function. Such requirement is either set forth by regulatory law or the governance rules of the relevant organisation. In the highly regulated credit industry, the role and responsibilities of the compliance function are more precisely defined than in other industries. This paper aims to analyse the personal accountability of senior compliance officers in a bankâ€™s compliance function when there is a failure of proper compliance.   Design/methodology/approach This paper is based on a keynote addressed at Jesus College, University of Cambridge, 7 September 2016. The author approaches the issue of senior compliance management by analysing development of international financial regulation with respect to legal requirements for compliance function. Subsequently, the author determines what constitutes senior compliance management and applies the various legal regimes to situations of compliance failures.   Findings While the accountability of the chief compliance officer and deputy for compliance failures is not set forth in regulatory law, courts and scholars have acknowledged such personal responsibility exists resorting to principles of civil law (contracts or torts), criminal law or employment law. Approaches and questions for this legal analysis are similar in a civil law as well as in common law jurisdiction. The most relevant breach of contract of the chief compliance officer will be an omission to act (forbearance), i.e. the failure to properly organize the compliance function and/or to immediately report a compliance risk to the board.   Research limitations/implications Scholarly work in the law of compliance is still somewhat limited, thus the research also includes practitionersâ€™ observations. The accountability of senior compliance management for compliance failures represents a growing trend in corporate governance to seek individual accountability for corporate misconduct; see, for example, US Department of Justice (DOJ) in its so-called Yates memorandum on â€œindividual accountability for corporate wrongdoingâ€.   Practical implications In incidents of non-compliance, banks and their compliance officers should be able to exculpate themselves if they can demonstrate proper organization of the compliance function.   Originality/value The originality of this general review is to focus the analysis of accountability of senior compliance management on the credit industry and to consider latest developments in international financial regulation, such as the supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP) by the European Central Bank (ECB) in the single supervisory mechanism (SSM) or the corporate governance principles for banks by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS).","http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-11-2016-0074?af=R","2018-01-24 12:01:26","59","Journal of Financial Crime"
"9200","Preventing Malfeasance in Low Corruption Environments: Twenty Public Administration Responses","Journal of Financial Crime, Volume 25, Issue 1, Page 170-186, January 2018. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose Corruption undermines good governance. Strategies for preventing malfeasance in low-corruption environments require a different approach to that applied in high-corruption environments. This paper aims to ask if criminological theories and practice contribute to the study and prevention of corruption in public organizations? Do crime prevention techniques help us in preventing corruption?   Design/methodology/approach Empirical data demonstrate that the overwhelming majority of public officials in rich countries demonstrate high levels of integrity; yet, significant sums are invested in anti-corruption agencies and prevention strategies. This paper reports on recent work with an anti-corruption agency, which forced us to re-think how to deliver an anti-corruption agenda in a low-corruption environment. The authors build on their research of public sector corruption in rich countries to develop a set of 20 situational corruption prevention measures for public administrators.   Findings The result, with lessons from crime prevention, is a prevention tool to support continued good governance in low-corruption environments. Figure 1 is a template that readers can apply in their own environments. Figure 2 is the authorsâ€™ attempt to populate this template based on the research reported here.   Originality/value The matrix of situational corruption prevention techniques provides two original approaches. First, it recasts the language of crime prevention into a non-confrontational approach to avoid alienating honest public officials. Second, the matrix incorporates common public sector functions to guide the development of context specific corruption prevention techniques.","http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-04-2017-0026?af=R","2018-01-24 12:01:26","93","Journal of Financial Crime"

Design/methodology/approach The analysis is based on the comparative law methodology of dissociation of â€œlegal formantsâ€, that is, on the study of separate contributions by each element of the legal system â€“ from black-letter provisions to judicial dicta, from scholarsâ€™ arguments to administrative practices â€“ to the making of legal rules in a given setting.   Findings Neither case law nor academic writing is abundant on this topic. Yet, it can be fairly assumed that an advisor who negligently drafts anti-mafia certificates might incur both contractual and tortious liability.   Originality/value The paper investigates an area, which has so far been largely unexplored, and, thus, contributes to paving the way for a better understanding of the legal framework applicable to the cases under examination.","http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-10-2016-0066?af=R","2018-01-24 12:01:26","55","Journal of Financial Crime"
"9202","Pyramids, Ponzis and Fraud Prevention: Lessons From A Case Study","Journal of Financial Crime, Volume 25, Issue 1, Page 81-94, January 2018. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose This paper aims to empirically identify factors that increase consumer vulnerability to pyramid scheme fraud and compares/contrasts dynamics and implications of pyramid and Ponzi fraud.   Design/methodology/approach Statistical techniques, including multiple regression, are used to analyze participant data (with over half a million individuals) from a now-defunct US-based pyramid scheme, Fortune Hi-Tech Marketing.   Findings Findings suggest that this pyramid scheme flourished in counties with identifiable affinity groups: religious communities, Hispanic populations and certain age cohorts (e.g. recently retired). Recruitment success varied significantly between geographic regions, with the highest levels of recruitment in the South. While prior research finds a possible positive relationship between education and Ponzi participation, this is not the case in the pyramid scheme studied. Furthermore, while Ponzi schemes might be pro-cyclical, collapsing during contractions when participants seek to extract their money, this pyramid scheme exhibited counter-cyclical behavior.   Practical implications State and federal regulators, as well as consumer protection advocates, should learn from analysis of past pyramid scheme cases. Such analysis informs allocation of scarce resources and supports the case for targeted, active education. Clarifying differences between Ponzi and pyramid fraud helps to support clear and effective intervention.   Originality/value This is the first research to analyze national participant-level data from a pyramid scheme to inform future action. While it confirms some past findings, such as the connection to affinity fraud, it adds to collective knowledge on pyramid schemes and the differences between pyramid and Ponzi fraud.","http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-10-2016-0062?af=R","2018-01-24 12:01:26","74","Journal of Financial Crime"

Design/methodology/approach This study uses content analysis to explore the extent of AML disclosure in the annual reports and the dynamic panel data two-step robust system to study the impact of the AML disclosures on banking performance.   Findings The findings show that AML disclosure is at a low level for all UAE banks, conventional and Islamic banks. The results also show that the degree of AML disclosure on the websites of the banks is higher than that in the annual reports.   Research limitations/implications The sample for this study comes only from banks traded on UAE markets. Thus, the results may not be generalizable to banks traded on other financial markets.   Practical implications Because of the cross-border character of the money laundry practices, our study suggests the UAE central bank to internationalize the AML regulations and develop an international AML regime as efforts to respond to the international development of the money laundry practices.   Originality/value This is the first study that develops an index to measure the AML disclosure and contributes significantly in providing greater insight in respect to AML disclosure in banking industry within the emerging markets.","http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-10-2016-0063?af=R","2018-01-24 12:01:26","83","Journal of Financial Crime"

Design/methodology/approach This paper examined 235 HNWIs who were involved in tax malfeasance after audited by the Inland Revenue Board Malaysia from year 2009 to 2013. A research model was developed to examine the influence of four independent variables which are tax rate, level of income, source of income and taxation performed by tax professionals on tax malfeasance.   Findings Multiple regression was used to test the proposed research model. The findings show that source of income and taxation performed by tax professionals influence tax malfeasance among HNWIs in Malaysia. This study also uncovers no significant relationship between tax rate and level of income with tax malfeasance of HNWIs.   Originality/value This study could be the first in Malaysia that has used actual audited data in examining tax malfeasance among HNWIs. This study provides important insights not only to the Malaysian tax authorities but also to tax authorities and tax researchers in other parts of the world, given the fact that tax malfeasance of HNWIs is a prevalent and universal problem.","http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-11-2016-0070?af=R","2018-01-24 12:01:26","54","Journal of Financial Crime"

Design/methodology/approach This study is an exploration of the duty to know or find out in the accountancy profession via discussion and illustration of how failures in this field contributed to the financial crash; a relation of these failures to â€œseek the truthâ€ to the concept of â€œepistemic virtueâ€; and a discussion of how a lack of epistemic virtue is a necessary condition for the successful practice of money laundering.   Findings This paper considers the case for establishing a new framework for recalibrating the professional ethic model so that the primacy of outward looking attitudes to knowledge is re-established at the heart of professional ethics.   Research limitations/implications The paper advocates the adoption of specific training on outward looking epistemic values in all financially related professional bodies.   Practical implications Review of ethical standards in the professions is required to ensure epistemic virtues are given due weight and prominence within them.   Social implications The accumulation of criminal capital under legitimate guises by serious organised crime requires poses an ongoing threat to the integrity of economic markets. A key step to improving defences against this threat is the elevation of epistemic virtue in the professions.   Originality/value To raise awareness and prominence of epistemic virtue as a necessary component of professional integrity.","http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-11-2016-0071?af=R","2018-01-24 12:01:26","176","Journal of Financial Crime"

"9214","Using Script Analysis to Understand the Financial Crimes Involved in Wildlife Trafficking","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>Wildlife trafficking has evolved in the last few decades from a critical conservation concern to a global security threat. What was once thought to be small-scale opportunistic behavior has now become a large organized trade partly run by criminal networks. Most research on wildlife trafficking has focused on the drivers of the trade and its modus operandi for catching, moving, and selling wildlife. There has been little research on the financial aspects of wildlife trafficking, despite how useful financial laws could be to prosecute traffickers in countries where environmental laws are weak. This research uses the crime script model and Gottschalk&rsquo;s (<em>Journal of Financial Crime, 17</em>(4), 441&ndash;458, <span>2010</span>) financial crime classification to study the financial crimes committed by wildlife traffickers during the trafficking process. Results show that financial crimes, including corruption, fraud, and money laundering, are part of every stage of the trafficking process for every actor involved. This research locates &ldquo;pinch points&rdquo; where it is most effective to intervene to dismantle the financial networks involved in wildlife trafficking and suggests interventions based on situational crime prevention principles.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10611-017-9725-z","2018-01-26 15:00:30","63","Crime, Law and Social Change"

                  <p>This paper reports the effectiveness of Emotional Fitness Training launched by the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) in enhancing four aspects of emotional fitness in police officers, namely resilience, positive emotions, cognitive flexibility, and emotional well-being. The Emotional Fitness Training workshops evaluated were conducted in three phases. Phase 1 workshops were offered to junior police officers and frontline commanders for voluntary participation. Phase 2 workshops were offered to supervisory staff with train-the-trainer purposes. Phase 3 workshops were also offered to supervisory staff, but as a regular training-day activity to let the staff learn to deliver training packages. A total of 300 respondents participated in the program evaluation exercises, and these were assessed before the workshop (pretest), immediately after the workshop (posttest), and 10&nbsp;weeks after the workshop took place (10&nbsp;weeks posttest). Most of the seven measures registered statistically significant improvements compared to pretest in all three training phases. We noted varying effectiveness in the three phases of training that could be attributed to the amount of out-of-class practice engaged in by the participants. We measured professional pride and organizational commitment 1&nbsp;year after the workshop and found that workshop participants reported greater pride and commitment compared with nonparticipants of the same rank. Among workshop participants, those with better emotional fitness also reported greater pride and commitment. The findings provide strong evidence supporting the effectiveness of emotional fitness training to enhance resilience, positive emotions, cognitive flexibility, and emotional well-being, and more importantly, they strengthen professional pride and organizational commitment even 1&nbsp;year after training.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9252-6","2018-01-28 09:16:31","123","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"

"9275","Illegal Fishing and Fisheries Crime As A Transnational Organized Crime in Indonesia","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing is increasingly drawing international attention and coastal states strengthen their efforts to address it as a matter of priority due to its severe implications for food, economic, environmental and social security. As the largest archipelagic country in the world, this is especially problematic for Indonesia. In this already complex geographical and security environment, the authors test the hypothesis that IUU fishing and fisheries crime(s) classify as transnational organized criminal activities. The article argues that IUU fishing is much more than simply a fisheries management issue, since it goes hand in hand with fisheries crime. As a result, although the two concepts are quite distinct, they are so closely interlinked and interrelated throughout the entire value chain of marine fisheries, that they can only be managed effectively collectively by understanding them both within the framework of transnational organized crime. To make this argument, the research utilizes qualitative and quantitative data collected from approximately two thousand trafficked fishers, rescued in 2015 from slavery conditions while stranded in two remote Indonesian locations: Benjina on Aru island and on Ambon island. The article&rsquo;s findings also unveil new trends relating to the inner workings of the illegal fishing industry, in four different, yet interlinked categories: recruitment patterns and target groups; document forgery; forced labor and abuse; and fisheries violations. The paper concludes by confirming the hypothesis and highlights that IUU fishing provides the ideal (illegal) environment for fisheries crimes and other forms of transnational organized crimes to flourish.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12117-018-9329-8","2018-01-30 03:32:16","47","Trends in Organized Crime"
"9276","A More Just System of Juvenile Justice: Creating A New Standard of Accountability For Juveniles in Illinois","<p>For over a century, America&rsquo;s legal system has made substantial reforms to change its treatment of adolescents. Every day, we see that our legal system treats adolescents differently from their adult counterparts. With regards to driving privileges, voting rights, and the ability to drink, our laws recognize that adults and adolescents are different and therefore require a different set of standards. America extended this treatment to the realm of juvenile justice in 1899, when Cook County, Illinois, created the country&rsquo;s first juvenile court. Originating in this court was the overarching purpose of America&rsquo;s juvenile justice system&mdash;rehabilitation of juvenile offenders. Though over a century has passed since the creation of America&rsquo;s first juvenile court, only recently has the law begun to treat juveniles differently from their adult counterparts. In the past decade, landmark Supreme Court decisions Roper v. Simmons, Graham v. Florida, J.D.B. v. North Carolina, and Miller v. Alabama have implemented constitutional shields for juveniles against the death penalty, life without parole, and improper Miranda waivers. In implementing these safeguards, the Supreme Court has employed new scientific understandings of juveniles, as well as common sense, to conclude that juveniles are different from adults and should be treated differently by the law. Though the Supreme Court created safeguards for juveniles in death penalty and life without parole circumstances, situations still exist that threaten the lives of juvenile offenders. Illinois accountability theory is one such situation. In Illinois, accountability theory is the mechanism by which the State can convict an offender of a crime which they did not actually commit. In Illinois, an individual who exhibited more than &ldquo;mere presence&rdquo; at the scene of the crime can be convicted of the same crime and sentenced in the same manner as the individual who committed the crime. Given the recent landmark Supreme Court cases, new scientific findings relating to the psychological understanding of juveniles, as well as simple common sense, accountability theory should not be used to prosecute juvenile offenders in Illinois.</p>","https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/jclc/vol108/iss1/5","2018-01-30 03:46:17","31","Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology"
"9277","The Fourth Amendment in the Age of Persistent Aerial Surveillance","<p>If Big Brother made movies, persistent aerial surveillance would be its masterpiece. Small airplanes are rigged with high-tech cameras that can continuously transmit real-time images to the ground. The aircraft is able to monitor an area of thirty square miles for ten hours at a time. This technology allows video analysts to zoom in and track the location of vehicles, and even people. It was originally designed for military use during the Iraq War, but since then, it has been adapted for civilian applications. In 2016, the Baltimore Police Department contracted with Persistent Surveillance Systems to carry out a trial run of aerial surveillance over the city. The public was not informed that they were being watched every day. The Supreme Court has long held that aerial surveillance itself does not constitute a search for the purposes of the Fourth Amendment. The persistency of this new kind of reconnaissance changes the calculus. Specialized airplanes enable law enforcement agencies to survey sizable regions for hours on end. It is precisely this power that makes persistent aerial surveillance more like constant GPS monitoring, which the Court has already considered a search. These modes of long-term observation are intrusive and violate a reasonable expectation of privacy. Police action must be analyzed over time as a collective sequence of steps, not just an individual instance. The aggregate search can qualify under the Fourth Amendment, even if the individual steps did not. This is because prolonged surveillance reveals privacies and intimate details of life that short-term surveillance does not. Repetition, indeed habit, are cornerstones of personality and identity. People may reasonably expect some form of surveillance. People may also expect those observations to remain disconnected and nondescript. This technology presents intriguing opportunities for law enforcement departments, in the investigation of crime, the presentation of evidence at trial, deterrence and crime reduction, exonerating the wrongfully convicted, and even traffic management and highway control. These advantages are not enough&mdash;and will never be enough&mdash;to avoid the command of the Constitution. Over time, the public has become more accepting of the surveillance state. The Constitution remains a counter-majoritarian check on the government. Absent probable cause and a warrant, persistent aerial surveillance is an unreasonable search that violates the Fourth Amendment.</p>","https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/jclc/vol108/iss1/4","2018-01-30 03:46:18","51","Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology"
"9278","Now You See Me: Problems and Strategies For Introducing Gender Self-Determination Into the Eighth Amendment For Gender Nonconforming Prisoners","<p>As the fight for transgender rights becomes more visible in the United States, the plight of incarcerated transgender individuals seeking medical care behind bars is likewise gaining attention&mdash;and some trans prisoners are gaining access to gender-affirming care. However, progress for incarcerated members of the trans community has been slow, piecemeal, and not without problems. As federal court opinions in Eighth Amendment access-to-care cases brought by trans prisoners show, how a court interprets the subjective intent requirements of the Eighth Amendment and how the imprisoned plaintiff pleads his/her/their case can make or break the claim. Further, courts and plaintiffs rely on medical diagnoses often couched in fixed binary transition to make a cognizable constitutional claim for medical care. For incarcerated gender nonconforming (&ldquo;GNC&rdquo;) individuals, the established binary-based medical diagnoses increasingly accepted by courts and prison officials may not reflect GNC individuals&rsquo; gender identities or medical needs. However, utilizing updated medical standards that enable patient gender self-determination in Eighth Amendment claims may extend Eighth Amendment protection to GNC people in American prisons. Deploying medical standards that are not aimed at binary transition in Eighth Amendment litigation can provide an avenue for incarcerated GNC individuals both to regain some power of gender self-determination and to ensure GNC prisoners have access to the gender-affirming medical care to which they are entitled.</p>","https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/jclc/vol108/iss1/3","2018-01-30 03:46:18","24","Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology"
"9279","Technological Incarceration and the End of the Prison Crisis","<p>The United States imprisons more of its people than any nation on Earth, and by a considerable margin. Criminals attract little empathy and have no political capital. Consequently, it is not surprising that, over the past forty years, there have been no concerted or unified efforts to stem the rapid increase in incarceration levels in the United States. Nevertheless, there has recently been a growing realization that even the world&rsquo;s biggest economy cannot readily sustain the $80 billion annual cost of imprisoning more than two million of its citizens. No principled, wide-ranging solution has yet been advanced, however. To resolve the crisis, this Article proposes a major revolution to the prison sector that would see technology, for the first time, pervasively incorporated into the punishment of criminals and result in the closure of nearly all prisons in the United States. The alternative to prison that we propose involves the fusion of three technological systems. First, offenders would be required to wear electronic ankle bracelets that monitor their location and ensure they do not move outside of the geographical areas to which they would be confined. Second, prisoners would be compelled to wear sensors so that unlawful or suspicious activity could be monitored remotely by computers. Third, conducted energy devices would be used remotely to immobilize prisoners who attempt to escape their areas of confinement or commit other crimes. The integrated systems described in this Article could lead to the closure of more than 95% of prisons in the United States. We demonstrate that the technological and surveillance devices can achieve all of the appropriate objectives of imprisonment, including the imposition of proportionate punishment and community protection. In our proposal, only offenders who have committed capital offenses or equivalent crimes, or who attempt to escape from technological custody, would remain in conventional brick-and-mortar prisons. As a result, our proposal would convert prisons from a major societal industry to a curious societal anomaly. If these reforms are implemented, the United States would spend a fraction of the amount currently expended on conventional prisons on a normatively superior mechanism for dealing with society&rsquo;s criminals.</p>","https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/jclc/vol108/iss1/2","2018-01-30 03:46:18","45","Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology"
"9280","Unmarked? Criminal Record Clearing and Employment Outcomes","<p>An estimated one in three American adults has a criminal record. While some records are for serious offenses, most are for arrests or relatively lowlevel misdemeanors. In an era of heightened security concerns, easily available data, and increased criminal background checks, these records act as a substantial barrier to gainful employment and other opportunities. Harvard sociologist Devah Pager describes people with criminal records as &ldquo;marked&rdquo; with a negative job credential. In response to this problem, lawyers have launched unmarking programs to help people take advantage of legal record clearing remedies. We studied a random sample of participants in one such program to analyze the impact of the record clearing intervention on employment outcomes. Using methods to control for selection bias and the effects of changes in the economy in our data, we found evidence that: (1) the record clearing intervention boosted participants&rsquo; employment rates and average real earnings, and (2) people sought record clearing remedies after a period of suppressed earnings. More research needs to be done to understand the durability of the positive impact and its effects in different local settings and labor markets, but these findings suggest that the record clearing intervention makes a meaningful difference in employment outcomes for people with criminal records. The findings also suggest the importance of early intervention to increase employment opportunities for people with criminal records. Such interventions might include more legal services, but they might also include record clearing by operation of law or another mechanism that does not put the onus of unmarking on the person with a criminal record.</p>","https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/jclc/vol108/iss1/1","2018-01-30 03:46:18","36","Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology"
"9281","Changes in European Instruments As A Reflection of A Shift in Legal Philosophies Relating to Community Sanctions and Measures","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>The number of persons under community sanctions and measures in the criminal justice system have grown rapidly in many European countries. In response to this phenomenon, the Council of Europe has issued several recommendations on community sanctions and measures in recent decades. The European Union has also published two framework decisions concerning community sanctions and measures that are legally binding on its member states. This article examines the shifts of the general legal philosophies of European instruments on community sanctions and measures, through a review of the subtle changes in the rhetoric of these. Results show that community sanctions and measures are increasingly promoted because of their inherent value, rather than simply because they provide the means to reduce the use of imprisonment. The European instruments assert interdependence between the two objectives of offender rehabilitation and public protection, consider the indicators related to both as the criteria for effective supervision, and understand community sanctions and measures as being not only efficiency oriented but also based on Europe&rsquo;s human rights framework. However, a particular concern &mdash; risk management of dangerous offenders &mdash; leads to looser interpretations of some principles of human rights. To retain the European image of resisting punitiveness, this problem can be addressed by firmer and stricter interpretation of these principles.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10610-018-9369-2","2018-01-30 07:31:04","31","European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research"

In addition, the study attempts to understand if CPTED results in crime displacement in non-target areas.   Design/methodology/approach This research utilizes a Weighted Displacement Quotient (WDQ) model to analyze the effects of CPTED, which is an appropriate tool in fields of regional-scale crime prevention and on sexual assault prevention. WDQ is capable of analyzing policy effectiveness while controlling for geographical crime displacement, a known side effect of CPTED in the literature.   Findings The analysis results show that CPTED is an effective tool to prevent sexual assaults in South Korea. The sexual assault occurrence rate decreased in the CPTED implementation zone of Yeomri-dong Mapo-gu. WDQ showed that crime displacement occurred in adjacent areas in Daeheung-dong and Ahyun-dong. But, crime displacement was lower than the policy effectiveness in the target zone.   Originality/value The policy implications of this research are immense. First, CPTED for the prevention of sexual assaults should be considered as a pre-control tool. Second, a strategic method for more effectively implementing CPTED is required. Third, because CPTED is a policy done on a regional scale, provisions need to be in place to manage crime displacement.","http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-07-2016-0100?af=R","2018-01-30 08:31:54","37","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

An exploratory meta-analysis then assessed the strength of their associations and interaction in Canada and the USA. Key knowledge gaps and specific future research needs, synthetic and primary, were identified. The paper aims to discuss these issues.   Design/methodology/approach A germinal methodological framework for conducting scoping reviews was used (Arksey and Oâ€™Malley, 2005). The authors searched for published or unpublished research over the past 15 years and retrieved 33 eligible surveys, 19 of which were included in a sample-weighted meta-analysis.   Findings The independent association of contact with attitudes toward police was estimated to be three times larger than the independent race association. Three large knowledge gaps were identified. Almost nothing is known about these associations among specific racial groups as they were typically aggregated into visible minority groupings. The authors have essentially no knowledge yet about specific racial group by a specific type of contact interactions. There is also a lack of generalizable knowledge as research has been largely restricted to locales.   Originality/value This is the first research synthesis of race and attitudes toward the police that incorporated contacts with the police. Its observation of the relative importance of contacts suggested a great preventive potential. This scoping review identified needs for a full systematic research review and a formal meta-analysis to plan future primary research including large national studies that are truly representative of Canada and Americaâ€™s diversity. Such will be needed to advance more confident knowledge about the factors that would support more trusted relationships between police and people in the communities they aim to serve.","http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-06-2017-0070?af=R","2018-01-30 08:31:54","42","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

Design/methodology/approach Controlled-laboratory experiments were conducted during which police participants (n=50) responded to equivalent numbers of black, white, and Hispanic individuals in multiple branching video scenarios in a use-of-force simulator. Within these scenarios, the attire of on-screen individuals was varied (â€œstreetâ€ or â€œbusinessâ€ clothing) as was their demeanor â€“ individuals were either friendly or confrontational. Each scenario had the potential to end peaceably or turn violent, depending on how the officers treated people in the simulator.   Findings Multi-level modeling revealed that neither the race/ethnicity nor the attire of on-screen individuals predicted how officers interacted with them. However, the demeanor of on-screen individuals did â€“ officers were significantly more likely to verbally escalate and end up with a deadly outcome when faced with confrontational individuals (f=3.96; df=1, 558; p&lt;0.05).   Research limitations/implications These findings offer important new insight into how fairly officers interact with people during routine encounters that have the potential to turn violent, and what this means for perceptions of police legitimacy, procedural justice, and allegations of racial bias.

The Capability, Importance, and Value (CIV) Tool allows police organizations to examine the roles their members carry out to determine whether they are being capably done, are important, and deliver value to stakeholders.   Design/methodology/approach Five focus groups were conducted with front line officers from a large Canadian police service. The focus group process incorporated elements of Appreciative Inquiry and Structured Brainstorming.   Findings Valuable information can be collected from front line police officers with the CIV Tool. Police organizations could use this information to improve performance while ensuring that the roles undertaken by their members align with broader organizational goals and objectives including providing value to stakeholders.   Research limitations/implications This study was designed as a limited test of the CIV Tool. More extensive testing is required with a larger sample that includes police investigators and members of other specialty units.   Practical implications The CIV Tool can serve to augment existing police performance measurement strategies. It can help to identify which roles contribute to achieving organizational goals and which do not. Based on this information, ameliorative action can be taken.   Social implications A â€œpublic valuesâ€ approach places emphasis on stakeholder needs and expectations. Addressing these directly can result in enhanced performance as well as greater police transparency, responsiveness, and accountability.   Originality/value Ongoing police performance assessment based on a â€œpublic valuesâ€ approach is uncommon in policing. Its use has important implications for police organizations and their stakeholders.","http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-11-2016-0171?af=R","2018-01-30 08:31:54","20","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"
"9287","Investing in People: Salary and Turnover in Policing","Policing: An International Journal, Volume 41, Issue 1, Page 113-128, February 2018. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between voluntary and involuntary turnover and officersâ€™ salaries.   Design/methodology/approach Using data from the 2013 Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics survey, Poisson regression was used to test hypotheses about the effect of pay and other economic incentives on turnover, while controlling for previously identified influential organizational and community factors, such as crime, community disorganization, geographic region, policing philosophy, collective bargaining, the utilization of body-worn cameras, and workforce diversity.   Findings Higher salaries were significantly associated with lower voluntary and involuntary turnover rates. In addition, other economic incentives and participation in a defined benefits retirement plan were related to voluntary separations but not dismissals. Consistent with prior research, southern agencies and sheriffâ€™s departments reported higher turnover rates than local police agencies and departments operating in other areas of the USA. The effects of workforce diversity were mixed, while collective bargaining was associated with lower rates of voluntary turnover, and the utilization of body-worn cameras was associated with higher rates.   Originality/value In addition to contributing to the theoretical literature on antecedents of turnover, this research has practical implications by helping law enforcement officials estimate how changes in the compensation structure affect their ability to retain qualified personnel. Due to the complexities of modern law enforcement, maintaining a strong and stable workforce is becoming a greater challenge, and more research is needed to understand which incentives are crucial in recruiting and retaining the most effective policing personnel.","http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-09-2016-0137?af=R","2018-01-30 08:31:55","51","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

Though instructive, mental-health-related calls for service are a significant component of police service to the community that have not been a part of this research. The purpose of this paper is to analyze calls for police service that relate to mental health, using intimate partner/domestic related calls for police service for context.   Design/methodology/approach Approximately 20,000 mental health related and 20,000 intimate partner/domestic related calls for police service are analyzed. Intra-week and intra-day temporal patterns are analyzed using circular statistics.   Findings Mental-health-related calls for police service have a distinct temporal pattern for both days of the week and hours of the day. Specifically, these calls for police service peak during the middle of the week and in the mid-afternoon.   Originality/value This is the first analysis regarding the temporal patterns of police calls for service for mental health-related calls. The results have implications for police resourcing and scheduling, especially in the context of special teams for addressing mental health-related calls for police service.","http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-10-2016-0153?af=R","2018-01-30 08:31:55","48","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"
"9289","The Impact of the Police Professional Identity on Burnout","Policing: An International Journal, Volume 41, Issue 1, Page 129-143, February 2018. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose Little research has been conducted which assesses the impact of the police self-identity on burnout. The purpose of this paper is to assess how identification with the police role, work centrality, policing values and perceived dissonance in values contributes to emotional exhaustion across the police career.   Design/methodology/approach Conjunctive analysis of case configurations (CACC) is utilized to examine how various factors conjunctively interact to influence the probability of burnout among officers at various career stages. This method allows for the examination of more complex interactions than traditional statistical methods.   Findings The findings suggest that the interaction between police values and professional identity is complex and neither completely supportive nor unsupportive of existing identity theories. Specifically, strong identification with the police role has both positive and negative effects over the course of the police career.   Practical implications Understanding how the police professional identity changes over the course of the police career can help to inform more deliberate and targeted training to help officers avoid burnout and improve the quality of policing for both citizens and police.   Originality/value The present research applies an emerging statistical method, CACC, to an important but understudied question â€“ the impact of the police professional identity on burnout throughout the career. In doing so, the present research illustrates that the effects of the professional identity on burnout are both complex, with significant ramifications for the practice of policing.","http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-03-2016-0047?af=R","2018-01-30 08:31:55","43","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

Design/methodology/approach To attain the aforementioned objective, this study employed the questionnaire survey approach for the collection of information from Taiwanâ€™s border police officers. A total of 277 questionnaires were completed and validated.   Findings The results showed that the subjective norms, perceived ease of use, and perceived usefulness positively influenced the usage intention of e-learning for police education and training. Second, subjective norms, job relevance, system quality, service quality, and ease of use were found to act positively on the policeâ€™s perceived usefulness of e-learning. Lastly, system quality and service quality acted positively on the policeâ€™s perceived usefulness of e-learning.   Originality/value The present study integrated TAM2 and information systems successful model into the research framework for building e-learning efficacy indicators. The good validation results obtained suggest the theoretical importance of this integrated model. The model and research findings closed the research gap especially in the application of police e-learning.","http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-10-2016-0157?af=R","2018-01-30 08:31:55","59","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

Design/methodology/approach International efforts to formulate and implement the Korean Desk are reviewed, by collecting legal and administrative literature on its implementation.   Findings The Korean Desk, as a newly implemented strategy to handle the increasing incidence of crime by and against Koreans in the Philippines, showed that direct communication and collaboration between police agencies significantly increased effectiveness. Creating the Korean Desk greatly assisted the resolution of criminal matters including extradition, cyber-crime, murder, robbery and others that involved Korean suspects and offenders in Korea and Philippines. The paper describes how the implementation of the Korean Desk evolved, the different roles of the Korean Desk and the police consul, and the substantial, positive outcomes of the project.   Practical implications Law-enforcement agencies are constantly formulating new approaches to enhance international anti-crime efforts. The successful collaboration described in this paper provides new insights and ideas for how, through close cooperation, agencies can benefit from, and enhance, those efforts. The paper shows how direct communication between the Korean Desk and local police in the Philippines can facilitate investigations, making them efficient and timely. Evaluation of the Korean Desk suggests that it has greatly contributed to international law enforcement.   Originality/value The overall steps for formulating the Korean Desk strategy and implementing it are examined.","http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-05-2016-0067?af=R","2018-01-30 08:31:55","46","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"
"9292","The Consequences of Traumatic Events on Resilience Among South Korean Police Officers","Policing: An International Journal, Volume 41, Issue 1, Page 144-158, February 2018. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose Drawing on survey data from South Korean police officers, the purpose of this paper is to explore the mediation effects of coping self-efficacy and social support in the relationship between the impact of traumatic events and resilience. Additionally, the moderation effects were assessed to examine how this relationship varies by the state of police officersâ€™ mental health.   Design/methodology/approach Both multiple mediation and multiple group models within the structural equation modeling framework were adopted to assess the proposed mediating and moderating effects.   Findings Traumatic events affect resilience not just directly but also indirectly through mediating factors such as coping self-efficacy and social support. These patterns are more pronounced in the high-risk mental health group than in the normal group.   Practical implications If exposure to traumatic events were an unavoidable aspect of police work, helping officers build resilience as a general capacity to overcome stressful situations would be an effective strategy to prevent many negative consequences associated with the traumatic events. This study examined specific causal mechanisms linking the impact of traumatic events to resilience to better understand the process of developing resilience among police officers.   Originality/value Instead of further examining the relationship between impact of traumatic events and other physical and mental outcomes, this study attempted to expand the current literature by identifying important mediating and moderating mechanisms that reduce the negative influences of traumatic events on resilience.","http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-08-2016-0133?af=R","2018-01-30 08:31:55","25","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

"9300","Does Treatment Quality Matter?","Research Summary
The Florida Department of Juvenile Justice has implemented a process to evaluate the treatment quality of interventions provided statewide in all long-term residential programs. In the current study, we examine the predictive validity of this treatment quality component in the prediction of recidivism of youth (N = 2,397) who completed juvenile justice residential programs from July 1, 2013 to June 30, 2014. We use hierarchical linear modeling to assess the effects of treatment quality (as youth are nested within programs), controlling for demographic and criminal history factors. The results indicate that higher average treatment quality scores of interventions received within a residential program decreased the likelihood of subsequent arrest, conviction, and reincarceration, whereas the highest treatment quality score of any specific intervention provided within the program decreased the odds of reincarceration only.


Policy Implications
In this study, we confirm the importance of fidelity and implementation quality in the provision of crime prevention treatment interventions to serious, deep-end juvenile offenders. Additionally, our results shed light on the ability of a juvenile justice agency to measure treatment quality in a substantively meaningful way with the use of limited additional resources. The services provided to keep communities safe, prevent future offending, and rehabilitate juvenile offenders must be held accountable for producing such outcomes, and one method of measuring such compliance is to evaluate the quality of the interventions with respect to staff training, fidelity adherence, evaluation, and corrective action processes.","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1111%2F1745-9133.12338","2018-01-31 05:15:37","53","Criminology and Public Policy"

"9303","Focused Deterrence Strategies and Crime Control","Research Summary
Focused deterrence strategies are increasingly being applied to prevent and control gang and group-involved violence, overt drug markets, and individual repeat offenders. Our updated examination of the effects of focused deterrence strategies on crime followed the systematic review protocols and conventions of the Campbell Collaboration. Twenty-four quasi-experimental evaluations were identified in this systematic review. The results of our meta-analysis demonstrate that focused deterrence strategies are associated with an overall statistically significant, moderate crime reduction effect. Nevertheless, program effect sizes varied by program type and were smaller for evaluations with more rigorous research designs.


Policy Implications
The available empirical evidence suggests these strategies generate noteworthy crime reduction impacts and should be part of a broader portfolio of crime reduction strategies available to policy makers and practitioners. Investments still need to be made, however, to strengthen the overall rigor of program evaluations and improve our understanding of key program activities associated with observed crime reduction impacts.","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1111%2F1745-9133.12353","2018-01-31 05:15:37","68","Criminology and Public Policy"

"9306","Civil Asset Forfeiture Laws and Equitable Sharing Activity By the Police","Research Summary
For several decades, critics have argued that civil forfeiture laws create incentives for law enforcement to increase departmental revenue by â€œpolicing for profit.â€ By using data on federal equitable sharing payments to nearly 600 local law enforcement agencies between 2000 and 2012, we examine the relationship between the characteristics of state forfeiture laws and equitable sharing payments to local agencies. Our results indicate that agencies in states with state laws that are more restrictive or less rewarding to police collect more in federal equitable sharing. This finding supports the criticsâ€™ argument that police behavior in regard to forfeiture activities is influenced by the financial rewards and burdens involved.


Policy Implications
Our results reveal that the findings of investigative journalism and case study research, that is, that police forfeiture activities are influenced by financial rewards, may be more generalizable to law enforcement than previously thought. Despite recent state-level reforms, federal equitable sharing and most state forfeiture laws provide limited due process protections and have minimal accountability or reporting requirements. Concerns about the impact of civil forfeiture practices on perceptions of procedural justice and police legitimacy are discussed, and possible policy reforms are reviewed.","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1111%2F1745-9133.12341","2018-01-31 05:15:37","42","Criminology and Public Policy"

"9311","Can You Build A Better Cop?","Research Summary
By drawing from psychology and economics, we present an experimental evaluation of a procedural justice training program designed to â€œslow downâ€ police officersâ€™ thought processes during citizen encounters. We find that officers who were randomly assigned to participate in training were as engaged in the community as similarly situated officers, but they were less likely to resolve incidents with an arrest or to be involved in incidents where force was used. These changes were most evident among officers who worked in areas with a modest level of risk.


Policy Implications
Police officers who are actively engaged with the public can reduce crime through general deterrence and by arresting criminals. Nevertheless, excessive discretionary arrests and the use of force by officers can reduce public trust in the police. To date, there is scant evidence as to how police departments can successfully train officers to balance enforcement and public trust in the field. Through our study, we demonstrate that a relatively minor supervisory intervention may cause substantive changes in how police and citizens interact with each other.","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1111%2F1745-9133.12337","2018-01-31 05:15:37","284","Criminology and Public Policy"

"9325","Differentiating Crisis Incidents: A Replication Study Using the Action Systems Model","Crisis incidents are volatile situations that can pose significant risk to those involved and to law enforcement. The idiosyncratic conditions that lead to such incidents, as well as their volatility, often militate against consistent explanatory models. However, the application of overarching paradigms, such as the action systems model, has shown some promise in imposing order in the domain. Recent research has successfully differentiated crisis incidents into the four distinct modes of the action systems model: conservative, adaptive, integrative, and expressive. The purpose of this paper is to attempt to replicate this recent study using 242 cases from the United States, Ireland, Canada, and Sweden. Data analysis involves smallest space analyses and constrained multidimensional scaling. Although the results supported the underlying structure of original proposed behavioural model, there are a few deviances. These differences along with the potential influence of cultural variations, offence variable selection, the type of incident, and the sample under scrutiny are discussed. It is evident that there remain several challenges, and further research is required, prior to developing a unified framework.","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fjip.1498","2018-01-31 11:01:27","39","Journal of Investigative Psychology and Offender Profiling"

The majority of medical neglect were related to concerns that the caregivers were unwilling to follow medical advice (45.9%) or unable to provide necessary medical care (26.2%). In line with the AAP guideline on medical neglect, all cases were managed by addressing communication difficulties (100%) and resource issues were addressed in 80% of cases.

Ninety-two physically abusive parents completed yearly assessments of their emotional expressiveness, as well as their children&rsquo;s self-regulation abilities. Observational and behavioral measures were also obtained yearly to capture both parents&rsquo; emotional expressiveness and children&rsquo;s self-regulation. Specifically, parents participated in a parent-child interaction task, which provided insight into their levels of flat affect. A puzzle box task was completed by each child to assess self-regulation. Results indicated, first, that greater parental expression of negative emotions predicted poorer self-regulation in children, both concurrently and across time. Second, parental expressions of positive emotions and parents&rsquo; flat affect were unrelated to children&rsquo;s self-regulation. Findings inform our understanding of parental socialization of self-regulation and provide insight into the roles of distinct components of emotional expressiveness. Moreover, findings have crucial implications for understanding emotional expressiveness in high-risk samples and increase our understanding of within-group functioning among maltreating families that may serve as a means to direct intervention efforts.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213418300218%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D3d6735642db476146ca025e7ebc7d239","2018-01-31 16:45:18","27","Child Abuse and Neglect"

An anonymous online survey of 271 CWS youngsters (10&ndash;21 years of age, 57.2% female) was used to assess trust and communication, and depressive symptoms/self-harm.

                  <p>This study explores the trends in police-recorded crimes in Europe and in individual countries. The offender characteristics such as gender and age of perpetrators are also considered. In addition, the analysis discusses factors behind the changes in the crime trends. Data were collected for the European Sourcebook of Crime and Criminal Justice Statistics by means of an electronic questionnaire, with the help of national correspondents. The dataset comprises metadata and crime rates (crimes/100,000 population) for 21 offense types. This article focuses on the results from the years 2000&ndash;2011. The overview of European crime trends is based on an analysis of the average annual change in homicide, assault, rape, burglary, car theft, robbery, and drug offenses. The trends in different crime categories vary: homicide has decreased in all European countries, and the decrease has been more rapid in those countries with a high homicide rate. However, the development of all violent crime seems contradictory, because assault and rape rates have increased in many countries. Property crimes, such as robbery, burglary and car theft, have decreased, but drug crimes show an increase. Overall, the findings suggest that property is currently better secured now than at the beginning of the century, but the situation in respect of violent crimes (excluding homicide) and drug crimes has not improved. In the future, efforts should be made to collect Europe-wide victimization survey data to supplement and deepen the understanding of the development of crime. In spite of the limitations, for the moment police trends are especially important, because up-to-date European victimization survey figures are not available.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10610-018-9370-9","2018-02-01 08:15:50","45","European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research"

Over the last decade, there has been increased media attention focused on the relationship between ASD and violent behavior due to a number of school shootings and high-profile criminal cases involving offenders with alleged ASD diagnoses. This coverage and these incidents have given rise to public concern and led to the perception that people with ASD are predisposed to violent behavior. In this manuscript, we provide a comprehensive review of the literature bearing on the relationship between ASD and violent behavior, and in doing so, characterize which people with ASD are most likely to be violent and under what circumstances. We conclude that, on the whole, while research findings are mixed, they lend support to the assertion that ASD does not cause violence, and indicate that when violent behavior occurs in people with ASD, it is the result of third variables including poor parental control, family environment, criminality, bullying, or psychiatric comorbidity (e.g., psychosis), that go undetected or untreated. The conclusions of this review have implications for families, clinicians, and policy makers, as a greater understanding of ASD-related violence risk is needed to combat misconceptions about people with ASD and the stigma associated with these conditions.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS1359178917301726%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D26c4791aaacbfe453d7b1c52c17dcff1","2018-02-01 13:00:08","39","Aggression and Violent Behavior"

The objective of the present study was to review the scientific literature and investigate how viewing and creating Child Sexual Exploitation Material (CSEM) can be understood dynamically. It is suggested that a motivated CSEM user, in acquiring new knowledge and techniques, goes through many stages and obstacles that lead ultimately to the contact sexual abuse of children. It is important to note that only a small proportion of individuals who follow the scripts described move on to the next step. The focus here is on the context and not on any causality between the steps, as the latter has not been demonstrated. Specifically, this study looked at the offenders' path from consumption of adult pornography, to consumption of CSEM, to its distribution, to child luring, and, finally, to child sexual abuse and production of CSEM.

                    <h3>Objectives</h3>
                    <p>Begun in 1939, the Cambridge-Somerville Youth Study (CSYS) is recognized as the first delinquency prevention experiment and the earliest example of a longitudinal&ndash;experimental study with criminological outcomes. This paper aims to develop a historical understanding of the origins of the study&rsquo;s research design.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>The present study is guided by the socio-historical approach and informed by past historical research in criminology. It draws upon a wide array of archival records and published works from the late nineteenth century to the present day.</p>

                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>Richard Clarke Cabot designed and directed the CSYS. Major influences on the study&rsquo;s research design can be traced to Cabot&rsquo;s medical practice and research, his advocacy for social work practice and research, and his professional relationship with the Gluecks. The beginnings of experimentation in the social sciences during the early twentieth century may have also played a role. Joan McCord&rsquo;s early involvement in the study proved instrumental to its longitudinal component.</p>

                  <span>
                    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>The rigorous and innovative research design of the CSYS marks an important chapter in the history of experimental criminology, and its influence continues to this day.

"9362","Correlates of Violent Political Extremism in the United States","Although research on terrorism has grown rapidly in recent years, few scholars have applied criminological theories to the analysis of individual-level political extremism. Instead, researchers focused on radicalization have drawn primarily from political science and psychology and have overwhelmingly concentrated on violent extremists, leaving little variation in the dependent variable. With the use of a newly available data set, we test whether variables derived from prominent criminological theories are helpful in distinguishing between nonviolent and violent extremists. The results show that variables related to social control (lack of stable employment), social learning (radical peers), psychological perspectives (history of mental illness), and criminal record all have significant effects on participation in violent political extremism and are robust across multiple techniques for imputing missing data. At the same time, other common indicators of social control (e.g., education and marital status) and social learning perspectives (e.g., radical family members) were not significant in the multivariate models. We argue that terrorism research would benefit from including criminology insights and by considering political radicalization as a dynamic, evolving process, much as life-course criminology treats more common forms of crime.","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1111%2F1745-9125.12169","2018-02-02 16:00:45","56","Criminology"
"9363","Reassessing the Breadth of the Protective Benefit of Immigrant Neighborhoods: A Multilevel Analysis of Violence Risk By Race, Ethnicity, and Labor Market Stratification","Researchers in the United States have increasingly recognized that immigration reduces crime, but it remains unresolved whether this applies to people of different racialâ€“ethnic and economic backgrounds. By using the 2008â€“2012 area-identified National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), we evaluate the effect of neighborhood immigrant concentration on individual violence risk across race/ethnicity and labor market stratification factors in areas with different histories of immigration. The results of our analysis reveal three key patterns. First, we find a consistent protective role of immigrant concentration that is not weakened by low education, low income, unemployment, or labor market competition. Therefore, even economically disadvantaged people enjoy the crime-reduction benefit of immigration. Second, we find support for threshold models that predict a nonlinear, stronger protective role of immigrant concentration on violence at higher levels of immigrant concentration. The protective function of immigration also is higher in areas of longer histories of immigration. Third, compared with Blacks and Whites, Latinos receive a greater violence-reduction benefit of immigrant concentration possibly because they live in closer proximity with immigrants and share common sociocultural features. Nevertheless, immigrant concentration yields a diminishing return in reducing Latino victimization as immigrants approach a near-majority of neighborhood residents. The implications of these results are discussed.","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1111%2F1745-9125.12172","2018-02-02 16:15:47","38","Criminology"

The aim of the current study was to examine whether contact with CPS is associated with improved mental health outcomes among adult respondents who reported experiencing child abuse, after adjusting for sociodemographic factors and abuse severity. The data were drawn from the 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey-Mental Health (CCHS-2012), which used a multistage stratified cluster design (household-level response rate&#8239;=&#8239;79.8%). Included in this study were individuals aged 18 years and older living in the 10 Canadian provinces (N&#8239;=&#8239;23,395). Child abuse included physical abuse, sexual abuse, and exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV). Mental health outcomes included lifetime mental disorders, lifetime and past year suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts, and current psychological well-being and functioning and distress. All models were adjusted for sociodemographic factors and severity of child abuse. For the majority of outcomes, there were no statistically significant differences between adults with a child abuse history who had CPS contact compared to those without CPS contact. However, those with CPS contact were more likely to report lifetime suicide attempts. These findings suggest that CPS contact is not associated with improved mental health outcomes.

Past evidence shows that family victimization may play an essential role in the way adolescents learn cyberbullying behaviors. Yet, research on the co-occurrence of family victimization and cyberbullying is limited. This study aims to investigate the associations between cyberbullying and family victimization among adolescents, and to examine the health correlates of cyberbullying and family poly-victimization. A large sample of 18,341 students, aged 15&ndash;17, from six cities in China, collected between 2009 and 2010 is employed in the present study, which investigated the association between various kinds of family victimization and adolescent cyberbullying. Data analysis was conducted in 2017. In-law conflict, intimate partner violence, elder abuse and neglect, and child maltreatment were associated with a higher possibility of children becoming internet victims. Parents&rsquo; divorce and separation, low family income, mother&rsquo;s low level of education, and father&rsquo;s unemployment were all associated with cyberbullying victimization. Cyber victimization was positively correlated to symptoms of PTSD and depression, self-harm, and other physical and mental health variables. Possible explanations for the relationships found in this study are discussed and implications for future research and services are provided. Proactive screening for family poly-victimization and cyberbullying is suggested.

In particular, protesters sometimes view violence against the police as warranted, especially if they perceive that police have treated them or their peers in a procedurally unjust or excessively forceful manner. This article examines the nature and correlates of attitudes towards the use of violence against police officers among Occupy Wall Street (OWS) protesters in New York City. Data were drawn from in-person surveys of 302 OWS participants on the 6-month anniversary of the movement in March 2012. Our findings reveal that in this context, respondents who perceive that police use unjust force against protesters are significantly more likely to endorse the use of violence against police.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay003/4836309?rss=1","2018-02-03 04:46:58","68","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"

                  <p>This study investigated the perceptions of police misconduct through a survey of police officers and electronic gaming service workers in Taiwan. A total of 297 police officers and 268 gaming workers in Taiwan participated in the survey-based study in which subjects were asked to state their views on the prevalence and likelihood of reporting of nine hypothetical police misconduct cases. The results were consistent with prior research indicating that both police and gaming workers rated some of the nine scenarios as more serious than others. Compared to gaming workers, police officers were more likely to rate the vignettes as examples of serious police misconduct, and to opine that violators should (and most likely would) be disciplined by their respective agencies. Overall, however, the police were less likely than gaming workers to report such police misconduct to higher authorities. Another consistent finding was that as the rank of the police officers increased, the likelihood of their ratings on police misconduct as a common practice decreased. The opposite was the case for gaming folks; the owners and managers of electronic-gaming stores believed such police misconduct was a common practice, while their respective clerks tended to view such misconduct as uncommon. Among the police, supervisors and anti-corruption officers were not likely to report such police misconduct, particularly those viewed as &ldquo;petty&rdquo; misconduct, inconsistent with the hypothesis. Also, no relationship was found between vignette seriousness and the prevalence among either police or gaming-worker respondents. Plausible explanations for inconsistent results were suggested.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10611-018-9770-2","2018-02-04 03:15:24","29","Crime, Law and Social Change"

                  <p>While the extant research on trust and confidence in the criminal justice system is broad in scope, its individual studies are more limited, leaving much unknown about these relationships. Building on prior research, the current study investigates the relationships between prior contact, victimization, and seven measures of trust and confidence in the police and courts. This study responds to calls for the relationships between trust and confidence in the criminal justice system, race/ethnicity, prior contact, and victimization to be investigated within a single study. Although rare in prior research, outcomes of trust and confidence in local police and courts are individually investigated within the same sample simultaneously. As a first, the current study also separates prior contact by police, courts, community corrections, and institutional corrections and examines four types of victimization (direct violent, vicarious violent, direct non-violent, vicarious non-violent). The latter allows for an examination of potentially more nuanced relationships between victimization and trust and confidence in the police and in the courts.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12103-018-9434-x","2018-02-04 07:15:09","31","American Journal of Criminal Justice"

We bring together evidence from epidemiological, longitudinal, and meta-analytic research to propose a theoretical model of how peer victimization relates to psychopathology, which in turn, leads to misguided attempts to alter physical appearance through disordered eating behavior, and highlight how the pathway may vary as a function of BMI and gender. Specifically, we argue that, as a result of being victimized by peers: (1) overweight adolescents will be at high risk of psychological dysfunction and disordered eating behavior (particularly binge eating), and the effect will be stronger in girls; (2) average weight adolescents will be at high risk of psychological dysfunction and disordered eating behavior (particularly binge eating and bulimic symptoms), and the effect will be stronger in girls; and (3) underweight adolescents will be at high risk of psychological dysfunction and disordered eating behavior (particularly to increase muscle mass), and the effect will be stronger in boys.

Due to the prevalence within this population of difficulties with anger and aggression, and the associated substantial individual and societal consequences, the provision of psychological interventions has become increasingly common. However, no critical synthesis of the empirical evidence relating to their effectiveness has previously been conducted. Sixteen peer-reviewed controlled trials or case series designs published between 2001 and 2016 met the inclusion criteria. The results highlight an emerging evidence base for the use of CBT in improving anger regulation, and for a range of psychological therapies in reducing aggressive behaviour. However, consistent methodological shortcomings limit the generalisability of findings and currently preclude firm conclusions on effectiveness.

                  <p>The US Supreme Court in <em>Kingsley v. Hendrickson</em> (<span>2015</span>) ruled that the use of a taser on a pretrial detainee for not following verbal commands, when the subject was not posing a threat to the security and order of the jail, was objectively unreasonable, unrelated to legitimate penological needs, and that the subjective intent of the officer was not to be taken into consideration. This is a major development in prison law as the US Supreme Court specifically addresses the issue of excessive use of force on pretrial detainees, who are distinct from prison inmates. Here, the objective reasonableness standard used in <em>Graham v. Connor</em> (<span>1989</span>) for excessive use of force by the police was applied to pretrial detainees instead of the Eighth Amendment&rsquo;s cruel and unusual punishment clause, thus clearly distinguishing pretrial detainees from those already convicted of crimes. Besides this decision, this paper looks at 10 Federal Circuit Court and US District Court cases involving the use of tasers and stun guns by jail officials on pretrial detainees and concludes that more emphasis on the use-of-force continuum or model, during jail officer training would go a long way in guiding in the appropriate use of tasers and stun guns, an intermediate and not an insignificant level of force, in keeping with the US Supreme Court ruling in <em>Kingsley v. Hendrickson</em> (<span>2015</span>).</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1057/s41284-018-0127-4","2018-02-05 13:17:15","25","Security Journal"

Neglected children (n&#8239;=&#8239;75) were more likely than an age-matched sample of non-neglected children (n&#8239;=&#8239;75) to yield to leading questions, despite no difference in their ability to recall the test stimuli. Subsequent collection of individual difference data from the neglected sample revealed that this effect could not be attributed to intelligence, language ability, problem behaviours, age at onset of neglect, or time spent in out-of-home care. With respect to social skill, however, suggestibility was positively correlated with communicative skill, and marginally positively correlated with assertion and engagement. While on the surface our social skills findings seem counter-intuitive, it is possible that maltreated children with relative strengths in these areas have learned to comply with adults in their environment as a way to protect themselves or even foster belonging. Our data, while preliminary, raise interesting questions about whether targeted interventions could help these children to more actively participate in decisions about their lives.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213418300152%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Dcd8a48d0fa1ffd9d74f0885a7ccd4f2e","2018-02-05 16:45:16","41","Child Abuse and Neglect"
"9408","Science-Based Interviewing: Information Elicitation","This article describes an ethical and effective science-based model of interviewing. An initial planning phase assists the investigative team in separating facts from inferences, decreases the likelihood of errors based on cognitive biases, and prompts careful preparation of the environment. The interview begins with an explanation of why the subject is being questioned. The interviewer then metaphorically hands the interview over to the subject, making him the talker and the interviewer the listener. The interviewer engages in active listening, soliciting as much information from the subject as possible by deploying tactics that enhance memory based on science, including elements of the cognitive interview. Cues to deception are found in the details of the story, rather than in signs of anxiety or nonverbal behaviours, and by deploying Strategic Use of Evidence. This model has been shown to increase cooperation, decrease resistance, and provoke useful information in real-world criminal interviews.","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fjip.1496","2018-02-05 17:02:00","62","Journal of Investigative Psychology and Offender Profiling"

While the nature of working with inmates can cause stress, work environment variables also contribute to the job stress of prison staff. The current study used the job demands-resource model as a theoretical guide to explore the effects of job demand variables (that is, perceived dangerousness of the job, and role overload) and job resource variables (that is, supervision, job variety, instrumental communication, and job autonomy) on the job stress of staff at a medium-security prison in Southeast Nigeria. Perceived dangerousness of the job and role overload increased stress from the job while supervision reduced job stress. Job variety, instrumental communication, and job autonomy did not have significant positive effects on job stress. The results partially supported the job demands-resources model; however, specific work environment variables varied in terms of their statistical significance. Prison administrators need to be aware of the contribution that work environment variables have on job stress and need to make changes to reduce job stress among prison staff.","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1111%2Fhojo.12245","2018-02-06 14:46:17","39","Howard Journal of Criminal Justice"

There were significant associations between CPT functions and the number of pediatric beds (<italic>r</italic>&#8239;=&#8239;.27), number of pediatricians (<italic>r</italic>&#8239;=&#8239;.27), number of outpatients (<italic>r</italic>&#8239;=&#8239;.39), number of emergency outpatients (<italic>r</italic>&#8239;=&#8239;.28), and emergency medical care (<italic>p</italic>&#8239;=&#8239;.009). In a multiple regression analysis, CPT functions were significantly associated with the number of CPT members, pediatric outpatient numbers, and pediatric emergency outpatient numbers. Japan has no CPT guidelines that outline what CPTs should offer in terms of structure, staffing, functions, and systems. Hospitals with many pediatric and emergency outpatients are expected to play major roles in providing services such as specialty care, intensive care, and education. They are also expected to play a role in detecting and managing child maltreatment, and have, by their own initiative, improved their capacities to achieve these goals.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213418300280%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Df27ffb332d8fcbc985670df0f22e283e","2018-02-06 16:45:16","41","Child Abuse and Neglect"

Prior research suggests that child protective services (CPS) caseworkers are more likely to substantiate maltreatment allegations when domestic violence and parental substance misuse are identified during the investigation, pointing to one possible mechanism for this disproportionate involvement. While previous studies have relied on nationally representative data sets, the current study used administrative records from a large Midwestern child welfare agency that accounts for state-level variation in child welfare policy and practice. A total of 501,060 substantiation decisions made between 2009 and 2013 were examined to assess the influence of caseworker-perceived domestic violence and parental substance misuse on the decision to substantiate reported maltreatment. Results from multilevel modeling suggest that the identification of domestic violence and parental substance misuse during an investigation significantly increased the probability that an allegation would be substantiated. The implication of these findings for child welfare practice are considered in light of the fact that many child welfare agencies do not consider exposure to domestic violence and parental substance misuse in and of themselves to constitute child maltreatment.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213418300565%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Da2ddd475095e8c15e3a7cc826540a279","2018-02-06 16:45:16","38","Child Abuse and Neglect"

Moreover, the effects of residential, school, and caregiver transitions during childhood on adult outcomes are not well understood. This study examined the relation between household adversity and transitions in childhood with adult income problems, education, and unemployment in individuals with or without a childhood maltreatment history. The potential protective role of positive relationship quality in buffering these risk relationships was also tested. Data were from the Lehigh Longitudinal Study (<italic>n</italic>&#8239;=&#8239;457), where subjects were assessed at preschool, elementary, adolescent, and adult ages. Multiple group path analysis tested the relationships between childhood household adversity; residential, school, and caregiver transitions; and adult socioeconomic outcomes for each group. Caregiver relationship quality was included as a moderator, and gender as a covariate. Household adversity was negatively associated with education level and positively associated with income problems for non-maltreated children only. For both groups, residential transitions was negatively associated with education level and caregiver transitions was positively associated with unemployment problems. Relationship quality was positively associated with education level only for non-maltreated children. For children who did not experience maltreatment, reducing exposure to household adversity is an important goal for prevention. Reducing exposure to child maltreatment for all children remains an important public health priority. Results underscore the need for programs and policies that promote stable relationships and environments.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213418300577%26_version%3D1%26md5%3De73d778e4ff80bece30ce1dbca87bb28","2018-02-06 16:45:16","38","Child Abuse and Neglect"

While medication, environmental planning and staffing resources are requisites for the management of challenging behaviour, effective communication is an important aspect in the management of these challenging behaviours including aggression. Good communication helps the patient become an active partner in the process. Staff training that focuses on communication skills can be useful to both patients and healthcare workers. This paper aims to review the research evidence from existing communication skills training programmes that are exclusively or partly focused on the reduction of aggression perpetrated by patients. This review included one randomized controlled trial protocol, one quasi experimental study, six pre-test/post-test designs, three mixed methods, four qualitative studies, one descriptive survey and four with other designs that were mostly conducted in mental health settings. The findings show that communication skills training improve the confidence of staff in dealing with aggression. However, minimal number of studies with a focus on aggression reduction, the quality of the studies in terms of design and lack of active controlled trials minimizes the generalizability of the findings. These findings reiterate the need for future research with a focus on well designed, active controlled studies to establish the effectiveness of communication skills training as a suitable strategy to minimise and prevent patient aggression.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS1359178916301288%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D1a8d6ccada7c78760f85bba2cd774045","2018-02-06 18:00:09","37","Aggression and Violent Behavior"

                  <p>This study involves an evaluation of an innovative approach to the handling of domestic violence (DV) cases in the city of Cleveland, Ohio that includes (1) a DV Project composed of specially trained police detectives, prosecutors and victim advocates for investigating and prosecuting domestic violence cases involving adult female victims who are married to, cohabitating with, or have a child with the defendant; and (2) a Dedicated Domestic Violence Docket that involves two Municipal Court judges hearing all of the domestic violence cases that are handled by the DV Project. We collected data on six months of domestic violence cases occurring in the latter half of 2008 (<em>N</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;1388), by linking records from the Cleveland Police Department, the Prosecutor&rsquo;s Office, and the Municipal Court. We found that very few victims in police districts lacking the DV Project follow up with a prosecutor to pursue the case further, indicting that specialized DV units in police departments can have a significant impact on the number of DV cases that move forward through the criminal justice system. DV Project cases were slightly less likely to result in charges issued by prosecutors (OR&thinsp;=&thinsp;.499) but more likely to result in dismissals (OR&thinsp;=&thinsp;2.545) and referrals to DV treatment programs (&chi;<sup>2</sup>&thinsp;=&thinsp;3.88).</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12103-018-9435-9","2018-02-06 23:30:12","176","American Journal of Criminal Justice"

Prosecutors working with child sexual abuse (CSA) cases involving young children have raised concerns that reliability criteria from the Supreme Court of Sweden are holding children's testimony to impossible standards (e.g., expecting the child's testimony to be long, rich in detail and spontaneous). This study aimed to address these concerns by investigating how District Courts and Courts of Appeal employ said criteria in their testimonial assessments of young child complainants.


Methods
Court documents from District Courts (nÂ =Â 100) and Courts of Appeal (nÂ =Â 45) in CSA cases involving 100 children age 7Â years and under were analysed with respect to the courtsâ€™ testimonial assessments.


Results
Testimonial assessments were more frequently referenced in acquitting verdicts and in cases with evidence of low corroborative value. Richness in detail was the most frequently used reliability criterion, followed by spontaneity. Most criteria were used in favour of the children's testimony. However, the length criterion was typically used against the reliability of the children's testimony.


Conclusions
Our findings confirm prosecutorsâ€™ concerns that criteria from the Supreme Court are frequently used in evaluations of young children's testimony. This is troublesome, as some criteria do not correspond to current research on young children's witness abilities. For example, compared to testimony given by older children or adults, testimony provided by a young child is typically not long or rich in detail. We encourage prosecutors to extend their own knowledge on young children's capability as witnesses and present this to the court.","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1111%2Flcrp.12124","2018-02-07 15:32:11","41","Legal and Criminological Psychology"

                    <p>This evaluation presents mixed findings regarding the effect of the intervention on violent crime. Inconsistent program effects may be attributable to incongruences between the program as implemented and the prescribed DDACTS model on which it was based.

"9444","The Organizational and Practical Considerations of Starting A Crime Analysis Unit: A Case Study of A Midwestern Police Department","<span><div>Abstract</div>In recent years, the concept of evidence-based policing has become commonplace in academic and practitioner-minded literature. The law enforcement community acknowledges the benefits of using data to guide policing strategy, yet still takes the acceptance of data analysis for granted when integrating it into the daily operations of police departments. How can data analysis be implemented in a way that provides value to police department managers and patrol officers delivering service? This article examines the start-up of a crime analysis unit in a large, Midwest police department in 2015. Using a case study analysis, the article examines some of the early successes and the potential pitfalls of a new crime analysis unit. Specifically, the article will examine the importance of culture change, the recruitment and selection of crime analysts, and the ongoing effort to provide value to department customers, as well as the community. The case study will focus academically on how change occurs within police organizations, but moreover on practical considerations that will be of great benefit to practitioners wishing to start a crime analysis unit or to improve an existing one. The article will add to the field of crime analysis by combining the insights of practitioners and the perspective of academics.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay005/4844067?rss=1","2018-02-08 07:47:19","161","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"

"9465","Policing the â€˜middle of Nowhereâ€™: Officer Working Strategies in Isolated Communities","<span><div>Abstract</div>Thousands of isolated communities across the globe are policed by officers who confront the challenges posed by distinctive geographic and environmental conditions, and many serve in places with a high proportion of economically and politically marginalized peoples in the population. This study reports the results of a survey soliciting the perceptions of 827 Canadian officers working in Indigenous communities; 260 of whom were deployed in isolated locations. Comparison of their responses using <span>t</span>-tests reveal that officers working in isolated communities confront a greater volume and seriousness of crime, and higher levels of social problems contrasted against their counterparts policing non-isolated communities. The results show that officers working in these locations develop a style of policing that is responsive to the characteristics of these places. Considering the perceptions of officers serving in isolated communities is an important step to consider when developing a list of best policing practices that are responsive to the needs of these places, regardless of where in the world they are located.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay007/4850523?rss=1","2018-02-10 07:01:58","250","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"

Initial reforms were symbolic, but important: they involved the renaming of the former militia (<span>milica</span>) to the police (<span>policija</span>) and the changing of insignias. Institutional reform reached its milestone in 1998 with the adoption of the new Police Act, which significantly changed police powers and introduced a civilian oversight of policing. The General Police Directorate became an autonomous body within the Ministry of the Interior. The year 2013 saw the adoption of new police legislation aimed at achieving decentralization, defining cooperation between the police and local communities by emphasizing problem-solving, community policing and intelligence-led policing. All legislative changes and efforts to improve policing in Slovenia are reflected in police training and the level of education required for entering the police increased from secondary school to a higher education qualification. Studies on efforts related to police reforms are also presented.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay008/4850524?rss=1","2018-02-10 07:01:58","213","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"

                  <p>Patron banning involves banning individuals who engage in problematic behaviour in night time entertainment precincts from certain areas. Patron banning is used in most jurisdictions within Australia despite a lack of evidence regarding its effectiveness. To have an impact, patron banning should act as a deterrent for problematic behaviour at a range of licenced premises (individual and general deterrence), as well as constituting as an immediate punishment which prevents future problem behaviours at the establishment(s) from which an individual has been banned (incapacitation). However, for deterrence to occur, the general public must be aware of the existence and basic functions of patron banning. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the level of public awareness of patron banning and its use. One hundred seventy-two participants anonymously completed an online questionnaire, comprising two sections: (1) demographic information and (2) participant&rsquo;s awareness, understanding, and previous experience with patron banning. The majority of participants indicated being aware of patron banning, but most did not know any details about it. The results of this study indicate that while individuals are aware that banning powers exist, they are less aware of how these powers are used in practice. In this way, patron banning fails to fulfil the requirements of a general deterrent. Given its expanding use, further research is needed to determine if patron banning does affect the behaviour of those receiving bans and of the community more generally.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9257-1","2018-02-12 13:16:40","61","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"

This paper examines representations of wardens observed as part of a study of 45 punishment memorialization sites across Canada. We analyze the symbolism used in these penal history museums, as well as the framing used to curate warden-related objects. Our analysis reveals that positive representations of prison wardens depict them as family-oriented, benevolent men of a strong character, who embody and command respect for authority.

"9479","Confessions of A Criminal Psychopath: An Analysis of the Robert Pickton Cell-Plant","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>Police interrogation methods have changed over time. While traditional techniques relied on violence and physical torture, modern techniques have shifted toward psychological coercion and manipulation. These techniques, most widely known as parts of The Reid Technique, have proven to be a powerful way to elicit confessions of guilt from suspected criminals. Authors of the Reid Technique claim that when applied correctly, their methods lead to significant increases in police confession rates. But, these techniques are not universally useful. In addition to eliciting false confessions, the Reid Technique has been less effective on psychopaths&mdash;who are self-centered, manipulative, and lack empathy. Psychopaths can be resistant to these methods, which rely on the interrogator&rsquo;s ability to induce fear, anxiety, and feelings of remorse in the suspect. When confronted with a criminal psychopath, interrogators face unique challenges requiring a different approach to interrogation. To show this, we analyze the cell plant video of an undercover officer who obtained a serial murder confession from Robert Pickton by appealing to his narcissism. We conclude by offering a few additional strategies that can be used by investigators when interrogating psychopaths.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9256-2","2018-02-13 10:46:30","63","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"

                  <p>It is well documented in the literature that child sex trafficking can be perpetrated by family members, though limited research has focused on describing this type of sexual exploitation. This pilot study addresses this gap by providing an analysis of familial sex trafficking considering trafficking dynamics, and rurality. Using a sample of 31 child welfare-involved children referred for behavioral health assessment and treatment, this mixed methods study explores: (1) victim and trafficker characteristics, the trafficking situation, law enforcement classifications of trafficking, clinical profiles of victims, and system involvement of children and youth involved in familial sex trafficking; (2) gender differences in clinical outcomes in sex-trafficked children; and (3) geographical differences in severity of the victimization experience. Major findings document high rates of family members trafficking children for illicit drugs; high severity of abuse as measured with the Sexual Abuse Severity Score, with higher severity of abuse for children living in rural communities; clinical threshold level scores on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC-A). Boys and girls had similar clinical profiles except boys had higher CBCL externalizing scores, and females had higher TSCC depression scores. Additionally, more than half of the children in this sample had attempted suicide in their lifetime. This formative study sheds light on the phenomenon of familial sex trafficking, thereby creating the context for further investigations. Implications for identification and effective responses to familial sex trafficking, with specific attention to gender and geography are discussed.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-9950-y","2018-02-13 18:16:31","55","Journal of Family Violence"
"9483","Understanding the Role of Marriage in Black Womenâ€™s Offending Over the Life Course","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Purpose</h3>
                    <p>Black women remain a traditionally understudied population in life course criminology and in studies of criminal desistance specifically. This work contributes to the desistance literature by focusing on within-group heterogeneity among black women, and examining whether variation in the structural position (measured at both distal and proximate points in the life course) conditions the relationship between a well-recognized correlate of desistance&mdash;marriage&mdash;and offending.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>The sample of 636 black females is drawn from the Woodlawn project, a longitudinal, interdisciplinary study of social adaptation, psychological well-being, and crime in a Chicago community cohort of black Americans who were in first grade in 1966. To test for potential moderating effects of structural position on the marriage-offending link, we employ hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) to simultaneously estimate variation in crime within-individuals while accounting for between-individual differences in offending.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>Findings suggest that both childhood and adult measures of structural position condition the marriage-offending link in important ways. Most notably, black women who are more socioeconomically disadvantaged reap greater benefits from marriage&mdash;in the form of a reduced probability of offending&mdash;than their more advantaged counterparts<em>.</em></p>

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>To the degree that women&rsquo;s pathways to offending are shaped by their socioeconomic marginalization, the practical benefits of marriage (e.g., economic improvement) might surpass other traditionally recognized mechanisms of desistance (e.g., social bonds) in their importance. Future life course research should highlight the complexity of lived experiences by explicitly considering one&rsquo;s race, gender, and social-structural position.</p>

                  <p>Although safety planning is a widely recommended intervention for domestic violence and sexual assault victims, there has been limited research on the safety planning process, content, context or effectiveness. This study builds on prior research to increase the understanding of safety planning in every day practice through focus group discussions with domestic violence and sexual assault advocates from a variety of settings. Five focus groups with 37 participants from a variety of settings discussed typical safety planning strategies and addressing the complexity of safety in challenging situations. Six main themes emerged with regard to typical safety planning strategies. Additionally, discussions revealed there are no widely accepted protocols or evidence-based strategies regarding how to assess and handle common but risky situations. Lastly, results indicate that risks are multi-layered and impacted by resources available to victims as well as civil or criminal justice system procedures, policies and victim status. It is essential that evidence based best practices and protocols be developed for safety planning for a number of high risk situations along with ongoing training, supervision and support. Future research is needed to examine whether, and how, safety planning best practices and protocols should differ depending on agency setting or delivery mode (e.g., hotline, case management, counseling) and geographic context.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-9951-x","2018-02-14 07:31:14","70","Journal of Family Violence"

                  <p>Although they are technically the first responders on most critical incidents, emergency dispatchers have received a modicum of attention from researchers and clinicians. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate job-related stress, psychological distress, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), stress resiliency, and posttraumatic growth in this high-risk group. These areas were evaluated via an assessment battery administered to 90 emergency dispatchers working in a law enforcement agency. Results showed that dispatchers experienced an average amount of occupational stress, with 24% of the current sample reporting significant job stress. Between 13.34 and 15.56% reported symptoms consistent with a PTSD diagnosis, and 16.67% indicated sub-threshold PTSD symptomatology. The findings revealed that, overall, dispatchers experience occupational stress, psychological distress, and sub-threshold PTSD at similar or higher rates compared to police officers. Further, dispatchers reported posttraumatic growth at an average rate, also similar to that reported by police officers. Clinical implications of the results are discussed. Suggestions for directions that future research might take are offered.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9255-3","2018-02-14 08:16:30","134","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"

"9504","Benefits and Challenges of Using Life History Calendars to Research Intimate Partner Violence","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>Research on intimate partner violence (IPV) suffers from high rates of attrition, which can be a problem for collecting longitudinal data. As one strategy to help address this problem, this paper will highlight the application of life history calendars (LHCs) to research on IPV. LHCs are cost-effective retrospective alternatives to longitudinal data collection strategies and have the potential to improve recall of events. Additionally, LHC data can establish temporal order and capture instances of repeat victimization. Quantitatively representing repeat victimization is especially important for IPV research because many IPV victims report experiencing more than one incident of abuse. First, a brief overview of LHCs is presented and the Chicago Women Health Risk Study is presented as an example to illustrate the utility of the LHC. Statistical methods to analyze this type of data are discussed as they relate to the data from the Chicago Women Health Risk Study. More specifically, the application of multi-level modeling with repeated measures and survival analyses (also referred to as event history analysis) to calendar data are reviewed. Particular attention is given to using survival analyses to analyze LHC data, especially in instances when the respondent reports more than one incident on the LHC. Benefits of calendar data, including improved recall of events and the ability to address questions related to repeat victimization, are highlighted. Challenges of working with LHC data, such as missing data and the use of open versus closed coding schemes, are reviewed.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-9955-6","2018-02-15 16:16:12","50","Journal of Family Violence"

                  <p> Partnerships between the police and the wider community to tackle safety issues are a cornerstone of contemporary thinking about policing. Using data from two studies into community safety partnerships in Northern Ireland and Scotland, this article argues that the level of policing &lsquo;with&rsquo; the community varies greatly depending on the particular safety issue that is being addressed. Using Osborne and Gaebler&rsquo;s (Reinventing government: how the entrepreneurial spirit is transforming the public sector, Plume, New York, <span>1991</span>) metaphor, I argue that there is a spectrum of issues that moves from inevitably high levels of unilateral police action where the police retain firm control over &lsquo;steering&rsquo; and &lsquo;rowing&rsquo; functions, towards issues that enjoy higher levels of police&ndash;community collaboration where &lsquo;steering&rsquo; and &lsquo;rowing&rsquo; can be shared more democratically. Outlining such a spectrum can help clarify the suitable expectations of what community safety partnerships can practically achieve.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1057/s41300-018-0042-y","2018-02-16 14:45:25","111","Crime Prevention and Community Safety"

                  <p>Are victims of intimate partner violence (IPV) by multiple partners (MP) different from victims of IPV by one partner? Are there different victim-related risk factors for IPV by MP? This systematic literature review identified seven empirical studies that related to these issues. The review findings indicated that (1) empirical research on IPV by MP appears to be scarce, with only limited recent development; (2) there were significant differences between women who had been subjected to IPV in a single relationship and women with IPV by MP; (3) IPV by MP was significantly associated with childhood domestic trauma, drug abuse, IPV characteristics, and attachment style; (4) regarding PTSD and personality disorders, the results were mixed and inconclusive; and (5) depression did not appear as a salient risk factor for IPV by MP. Interpretations must be made cautiously because of the wide diversity in measurement approaches. It is important that service personnel and researchers attend with increased awareness to women with IPV by MP.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-9952-9","2018-02-17 14:31:25","105","Journal of Family Violence"
"9525","The Treadmill of Taxation: Desertification and Organizational State Deviance in Minqin Oasis, China","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>Green criminology has long proposed a political economy approach towards the study of environmental harm. This paper engages with that emerging scholarship by examining how land reclamation and organizational state deviance contributed to severe desertification from 1986 to 2005 in Minqin County, China. Specifically, the study examines how macro-level tax reforms in post-socialist China provided the motive, opportunities, and operationality of social control that enabled the under-enforcement of conservation regulations in the Minqin oasis. The findings demonstrate that organizational state deviance was structured in an interwoven web of fiscal obligations and patronage relationships generated by the incessant tax burden imposed on grassroots state actors and local farmers. The data comes from 110 in-depth interviews of local farmers and grassroots actors as well as 7237 pages of policy reports gathered from regional and local archives in northwestern China.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10612-018-9386-y","2018-02-17 17:30:49","31","Critical Criminology"

                  <p>Because the effects of children&rsquo;s exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV) carry long lasting consequences for the affected children, IPV exposure may impose a significant economic burden to localities, states, and society at large, made explicit over the victim&rsquo;s lifetime and over a wide range of behaviors and outcomes, including use of social services, health and healthcare utilization, educational outcomes, workforce productivity, and criminal behavior. While much research has been conducted on the effect of IPV exposure on multiple short- and long-term outcomes, no research to date has examined the economic burden associated with IPV exposure. Using an incidence-based approach, we estimated the aggregate discounted costs associated with healthcare spending, criminal behavior, and labor market productivity accrued by a 20-year-old victim in 2016 projected to the age of 65, applying a 3% discount rate. The average lifetime costs derived from childhood IPV exposure are estimated to be over $50,000 per victim (2016 U.S. dollars) due to increased healthcare costs ($11,000), increased crime costs ($14,000), and productivity losses ($26,000). Over an annual birth cohort of young adults, these costs amount to over $55&nbsp;billion nationwide. IPV exposure imposes a substantial economic burden to society at large in the form of increased healthcare costs, increased crime costs, and reduced productivity. This study offers an explicit quantification of substantial lifetime costs, which should encourage policy makers to redouble efforts to reduce the incidence of IPV and successfully ameliorate its effects on IPV-exposed children.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-9954-7","2018-02-19 01:16:09","57","Journal of Family Violence"
"9529","Identifying the Needs of American Indian Women Who Sought Shelter: A Practitioner-Researcher Partnership","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>American Indian women across all ages are significantly more likely than women of other ethnic groups to be victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking. Despite their increased risk of interpersonal violence, there are few published studies or reports that explicitly examine the needs of victimized American Indian women. Therefore, both researchers and service providers know very little about the multifaceted needs of victimized American Indian women and whether current community services are meeting the needs of victimized native women. Identifying such needs is a logical next step so that victim service agencies can develop and effectively provide services tailored to victimized American Indian women. This commentary addresses these gaps by (1) identifying the needs of American Indian women in a domestic violence shelter in Arizona, and (2) highlighting the researcher-practitioner partnership that made it possible to gain access to these victims. Drawing on survey responses from 37 American Indian female clients and interviews with 10 staff members, the findings reveal that the domestic violence agency service provider is meeting many of their needs. Findings also indicate that clients have a wide variety of specific personal needs (e.g., safety, housing, transportation), needs relating to their children (e.g., safety, education, socialization), community needs (e.g., relating to their tribe), as well as legal needs (e.g., help obtaining a restraining order or divorce). These multifaceted needs are discussed and specific recommendations are provided for successful researcher-practitioner partnerships.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-9953-8","2018-02-19 05:16:17","34","Journal of Family Violence"

Specific activities include proactive tasks such as citizen engagement and community outreach as well as traditional tasks related to follow-up on known crimes. The results suggest that officers who spend more time working foot patrol in an area are more likely to identify problems. Citizen engagement and community outreach are not related to problem identification; however some traditional policing activities are. The results suggest that foot patrol may result in intermediate benefits distinct from crime reduction and that departments conducting foot patrol interventions should assign specific officers to individual neighborhoods to maximize value.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay006/4877010?rss=1","2018-02-20 05:01:53","230","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"

"9569","Geographical Offender Profiling: Dragnet's Applicability on A Brazilian Sample","Even though geographical offender profiling is already widely used and researched in countries such as England, Canada, and United States, it is still severely overlooked in Brazil, as there are no researches on the subject using a Brazilian sample. Therefore, the present paper aims to start filling this gap by analysing the applicability of the geographical offender profiling and Dragnet on a sample of Brazilian serial killers. In order to achieve this objective, the authors collected data through police records on 15 serial killers that were active between June 2009 and June 2015, in the city of Campina Grande, ParaÃ­ba, Brazil. As a result, the circle hypothesis was confirmed, considering that 66.7% of the sample fell into the marauder category. Interestingly, the Dragnet's result accurately informed the area that contained the offender's base in the same cases in which the offender acted according to the marauder model. Also, other important correlations were found such as the influence of age, intelligence, resourcefulness, and method of approach on the distance travelled to commit a murder. Those results show that the geographical offender profiling can be effectively applied in Brazil and thus is a valid investigative tool to aid police officers in serial crimes investigations.","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fjip.1497","2018-02-20 11:16:49","36","Journal of Investigative Psychology and Offender Profiling"

                  <p>Criminological research has long utilized visual representations of environments in seeking to explore perceptions of crime and personal safety and to investigate the relevance of specific design and security features. Much of this research has been in the field of environmental psychology and crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED). This paper traces the development of visual representations and the use of environmental stimuli in criminological research. We briefly review the contributions made by various visual media, including maps and drawings, photographs, models, video, virtual reality and gaming engines. These developments in visualization, building design and management technology have drastically improved the realism of representations of environments, and the potential for more standardized, widespread exploration and application of CPTED principles to reduce crime. To scope and evaluate the future potential of such emergent technologies, we critically review the literature concerned with virtual reality and building information technology (BIM), outlining uses in practice and new opportunities for criminological research. We frame the discussion with specific focus on analysing proposed residential dwellings to reduce vulnerability to burglary. A layered exploration for how BIM technologies may assist in implementing increasingly sophisticated assessments of crime vulnerability for proposed residential building designs brings the paper to a close. These discussions provide both a comprehensive overview for interested practitioners and chart specific opportunities for further research.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1057/s41300-018-0039-6","2018-02-20 13:30:26","38","Crime Prevention and Community Safety"

"9575","Poisoned Development: Assessing Childhood Lead Exposure As A Cause of Crime in A Birth Cohort Followed Through Adolescence","The consequences of lead exposure for later crime are theoretically compelling, but direct evidence from representative, longitudinal samples is sparse. By capitalizing on an original follow-up of more than 200 infants from the birth cohort of the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods matched to their blood lead levels from around age 3 years, we provide several tests. Through the use of four waves of longitudinal data that include measures of individual development, family background, and structural inequalities in how lead becomes embodied, we assess the hypothesized link between early childhood lead poisoning and both parent-reported delinquent behavior and official arrest in late adolescence. We also test for mediating developmental processes of impulsivity and anxiety or depression. The results from multiple analytic strategies that make different assumptions reveal a plausibly causal effect of childhood lead exposure on adolescent delinquent behavior but no direct link to arrests. The results underscore lead exposure as a trigger for poisoned development in the early life course and call for greater integration of the environment into theories of individual differences in criminal behavior.","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1111%2F1745-9125.12171","2018-02-20 17:00:43","53","Criminology"

Police-involved victims of IPV were interviewed at two time-points. Of the 266 cases, the offender was arrested in 105 (39.5%) cases. In a logistic regression model, physical violence was the strongest predictor of arrest while risk for homicide was not predictive. Upon examination of the factors that predicted further violence, there was a linear relationship between risk of homicide and the severity and frequency of future violence. Arrest and physical violence at the index offense were not associated with violence at follow-up. The use of risk assessment by law enforcement officers may assist with criminal justice decision-making and referral to appropriate interventions.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay004/4883358?rss=1","2018-02-21 08:02:17","51","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"

                    <span>
                      <h3>Objective</h3>
                      <p>The current study proposes unique methods for apportioning existing census data in blocks to street segments and examines the effects of structural characteristics of street segments on crime. Also, this study tests if the effects of structural characteristics of street segments are similar with or distinct from those of blocks.</p>

                    <span>
                      <h3>Methods</h3>
                      <p>This study compiled a unique dataset in which block-level structural characteristics are apportioned to street segments utilizing the 2010 U.S. Census data of the cities of Anaheim, Santa Ana, and Huntington Beach in Orange County, California. Negative binomial regression models predicting crime that include measures of social disorganization and criminal opportunities in street segments and blocks were estimated.</p>

                    <span>
                      <h3>Results</h3>
                      <p>The results show that whereas some of the coefficients tested at the street segment level are similar to those aggregated to blocks, a few were quite different (most notably, racial/ethnic heterogeneity). Additional analyses confirm that the imputation methods are generally valid compared to data actually collected at the street segment level.</p>

                    <span>
                      <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                      <p>The results from the street segment models suggest that the structural characteristics from social disorganization and criminal opportunities theories at street segments may operate as crucial settings for crime. Also the results indicate that structural characteristics have generally similar effects on crime in street segments and blocks, yet have some distinct effects at the street segment level that may not be observable when looking at the block level. Such differences underscore the necessity of serious consideration of the issues of level of aggregation and unit of analysis when examining the structural characteristics-crime nexus.</p>

                      <p>Examining the immigration-crime nexus across neighborhoods in the Southern California metropolitan region, this study builds on existing literature by unpacking immigration and accounting for the rich diversity that exists between immigrant groups.</p>

                      <h3>Methods</h3>
                      <p>Using data from a variety of sources, we capture this diversity with three different approaches, operationalizing immigrant groups by similar racial/ethnic categories, areas or regions of the world that immigrants emigrate from, and where immigrants co-locate once they settle in the U.S. We also account for the heterogeneity of immigrant populations by constructing measures of immigrant heterogeneity based on each of these classifications. We compare these novel approaches with the standard approach, which combines immigrants together through a single measure of percent foreign born.</p>

                    <span>
                      <h3>Objectives</h3>
                      <p>This study examines sentencing patterns for environmental crimes and tests the assumption that &ldquo;green&rdquo; offenders receive more lenient treatment from criminal courts than non-environmental offenders.</p>
                    </span>
                    <span>
                      <h3>Methods</h3>
                      <p>We present two sets of analyses. First, we present an empirical portrait of environmental felony offenses convicted in a single state (Florida) over a fifteen-year period and the resulting criminal sanctions. Second, we use a precision matching analysis to assess whether environmental offenders receive more lenient treatment when compared to non-environmental offenders with the same characteristics and offense severity scores.</p>
                    </span>
                    <span>
                      <h3>Results</h3>
                      <p>Findings indicate that an overall small percentage of felony convictions in state courts stem from environmental crimes. We also find that punishments for environmental crimes are more lenient than sanctions assigned to comparable non-environmental offenses when the environmental crime is ecological, but that punishments are sometimes harsher when the environmental crime involves animals.</p>

                      <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                      <p>The findings provide general support for the argument that courts and other formal institutions of social control treat environmental crimes more leniently than non-environmental crimes. This paper also raises important questions about citizen and state actors&rsquo; perceptions of crimes against the environment and, more generally, about the ways in which theories of court sentencing behaviors apply to environmental crime sanctioning decisions.</p>

"9606","Within-Subjects Verbal Lie Detection Measures: A Comparison Between Total Detail and Proportion of Complications","Background
We examined whether the verbal cue, proportion of complications, was a more diagnostic cue to deceit than the amount of information provided (e.g., total number of details).


Method
In the experiment, 53 participants were interviewed. Truth tellers (nÂ =Â 27) discussed a trip they had made during the last twelve months; liars (nÂ =Â 26) fabricated a story about such a trip. The interview consisted of an initial recall followed by a model statement (a detailed account of an experience unrelated to the topic of investigation) followed by a post-model statement recall. The key dependent variables were the amount of information provided and the proportion of all statements that were complications.


Results
The proportion of complications was significantly higher amongst truth tellers than amongst liars, but only in the post-model statement recall. The amount of information provided did not discriminate truth tellers from liars in either the initial or post-model statement recall.


Conclusion
The proportion of complications is a more diagnostic cue to deceit than the amount of information provided as it takes the differential verbal strategies of truth tellers and liars into account.","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1111%2Flcrp.12126","2018-02-22 07:16:45","19","Legal and Criminological Psychology"
"9607","The Psychological Impact of Solitary: A Longitudinal Comparison of General Population and Long-Term Administratively Segregated Male Inmates","Purpose
This study expands upon existing research on the psychological impact of administrative segregation on inmates by addressing several methodological limitations in this body of literature.


Methods
Using a preâ€“post design, this study compared male general population (GP) inmates in the United States to those with up to 4Â years in segregated placement across scores on the MCMI-III.


Results
While segregated inmates reported higher levels of distress (particularly on measures of anxiety, depressed mood, post-traumatic stress, and somatic complaints) compared to the GP at post-assessment, scores did not reach the clinical cut-off. Further, inmates generally did not deteriorate as time in restrictive housing increased.


Conclusions
Thus, compared to the GP, who showed some improvement in functioning, segregated inmates remained largely the same. Rather than causing significant psychological damage, it is more likely that segregation is a barrier to opportunities for continued growth. Study limitations and recommendations for reforms in the use of segregation are presented.","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1111%2Flcrp.12125","2018-02-22 07:16:45","28","Legal and Criminological Psychology"
"9608","The Dangers of Co-Witness Familiarity: Investigating the Effects of Co-Witness Relationships on Blame Conformity","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of pre-existing relationships between co-witnesses on statement similarity, after a post-event discussion. Although research studies have attempted to observe the effect of a pre-existing relationship on eyewitness pairs, few have investigated these effects on larger groups of co-witnesses. Four hundred and twenty participants took part in an eyewitness simulation experiment. Participants were placed into groups of five, and viewed video footage of a bar fight. After witnessing the event, participants discussed the event with group members before giving individual statements privately. The study employed a one-way between subjects design with three conditions: (1) participants discussed the event with familiar co-witnesses, (2) participants discussed the event with unfamiliar co-witnesses and (3) participants were not permitted to discuss the event with their co-witnesses (control). It was found that post-event discussion between co-witnesses increased the level of similarity in blame attribution within the eyewitness groups; however, this difference was only significant in groups where eyewitnesses shared a pre-existing relationship. In addition, the level of uncertainty was reduced when eyewitnesses took part in post-event discussions. It is suggested that this might be attributed to an increased level of informational influence between familiar co-witnesses. However, there was no evidence suggesting that post-event discussions led to an increase in false eyewitness statements.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9254-4","2018-02-22 09:16:50","55","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"

"9615","Policing Extreme Political Protest: A Historical Evaluation of Police Prejudice","<span><div>Abstract</div>The task of policing political activism frequently tests the legitimacy of the police leaving them vulnerable to claims of political prejudice. The principle of police neutrality has been subjected to criticism by MPs, activists and academic scholars since the formation of the modern police force. Members of both far right and far left movements have claimed their liberty to protest has been curtailed at different moments and much academic scholarship has highlighted the pro-fascist nature of policing. This article redresses the balance to provide a deeper understanding of the way political activism was (and continues to be) policed. In recent years, protests involving the English Defence League and the Occupy movement have highlighted the contemporary challenges to public order operations. Both groups have questioned the political impartiality of the police. Yet, these accusations are not new and by offering a historical comparison to the policing of extreme political activism in the interwar years, concerns regarding police culture, discretion, and legitimacy in the contemporary era are addressed. The inconsistent policing of the British Union of Fascists and the Communist Party of Great Britain frustrated both groups, and this article challenges existing research which claims that a pro-fascist motivation in policing accounts for this inconsistency. By exploring other motivations, it argues that we should not see the police as a monolithic institution with a particular view, and although political partiality is still significant, other key factors such as legal ambiguity, police pragmatism and regional variations must also be taken into account.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay010/4903019?rss=1","2018-02-22 14:01:54","70","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"

                  <p>Much research exists to demonstrate that strategies related to situational crime prevention are important for reducing opportunities for crime. Despite evidence for these strategies, many municipalities and developers do not implement them consistently or appropriately. The current study explores the impact of disregarding such research in a housing development in the southern USA. The failure of proper security measures may lead to higher levels of property and violent crime. Alternatively, surrounding developments, with better site management and access control, may experience fewer police calls for service.

                  <p>This exploratory study examines the experiences of foreign national prisoners and the motivations and barriers to their participation in prison programmes (e.g. educational courses, use of the prison library, prison work, sociocultural activities, sports). Data are derived from 15 individual interviews with foreign national prisoners in two Belgian prisons. During the interviews the strengths-based approach of Appreciative Inquiry was used. The results demonstrate that foreign national prisoners experience motivations and barriers that can be placed at the different levels of the ecological model of Bronfenbrenner (<span>1979</span>) which affect individual behaviour: micro-, meso-, exo- and macro-level. Foreign national prisoners were often motivated to participate in prison programmes to improve their health (micro-level) or to facilitate contact inside and outside prison (meso-level). The reverse was also possible; foreign national prisoners were limited in their participation in prison programmes by their social networks (meso-level) and a lack of knowledge and understanding of the available activities (exo-level). In conclusion, limitations, guidelines for further research and implications for practice and policy are considered.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10610-018-9372-7","2018-02-22 22:30:44","25","European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research"

                  <p>This paper focuses on the regulation of prostitution in the Netherlands from the twentieth century onward. It aims to provide a full description of the Dutch position on prostitution through the interpretation and explanation of current Dutch prostitution policy. This will be achieved by analyzing the legal narratives that substantiate the legal rules provided in both Dutch criminal and administrative law concerning the regulation of prostitution. We analyze the Dutch prostitution legislation of the past, present, and future, using a newly developed analytical framework. Using this framework, we reconstruct the legislator&rsquo;s attitude towards prostitution using insights from previous theoretical work on prostitution and using models aimed at regulating this phenomenon that range from a total ban to full decriminalization. In our analysis, we also use the legitimating grounds for application of criminal law developed by Feinberg. These grounds are also used in this paper to interpret the administrative intervention in prostitution. This paper reveals a paradox: The idea of a liberal dream goes hand-in-hand with growing repression of freedom in the Dutch prostitution sector.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10610-018-9371-8","2018-02-23 10:15:48","59","European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research"

                    <h3>Objectives</h3>
                    <p>Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a type of computer simulation that creates a virtual society and allows controlled experimentation. ABM has the potential to be a powerful tool for exploring criminological theory and testing the plausibility of crime prevention interventions when data are unavailable, when they would be unethical to collect, or when policy-makers need an answer quickly. This paper takes stock of the current literature to discuss the potential contributions of ABM, assess current practice, identify shortcomings that threaten the validity of findings using ABM, and to make suggestions regarding the construction and communication of future work using ABM.</p>

                    <p>We systematically searched major databases to find all publications using ABM to simulate urban crime patterns and coded publications to quantify the following information: (1) characteristics of the publication, the model and the agents, (2) model purpose, (3) crime type investigated, and (4) interrogation of the model via sensitivity testing and validation.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>After sifting papers according to our inclusion criteria, we identified and reviewed 45 publications. Models informed by the opportunity theory framework dominated. Most publications lacked detail sufficient to enable replication. Many did not include clear a rationale for modeling choices, parameter selection or calibration. Rarely were parameters calibrated using empirical data. Model validation was limited and inconsistent across papers.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>ABM offers significant potential for criminological enquiry. However, at present, the lack of model detail reported in publications makes it difficult to assess where sufficient evidence exists to support&mdash;and where gaps limit&mdash;the development of models that reflect extant conditions and offender decision-making. For the field to progress, as a minimum, standardized reporting that encourages transparency will be necessary.</p>

                  <p>The theory of fundamental causes in medical sociology identifies socioeconomic status and racism as fundamental causes of disease and health disparities. We draw on this theory to argue that socioeconomic status and racism are also fundamental causes of violent and property crime. In line with the theory, we argue that criminology should pay increased attention to socioeconomic status and racism for the most far-reaching reductions in street criminality to be achieved.

"9640","From Bikers to Savvy Criminals. Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs in Australia: Implications For Legislators and Law Enforcement","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>This article will examine outlaw motorcycle gang criminality in Australia and the difficulties faced by legislators and law enforcement agencies in responding to this concern. Adding further complication to the issue for the state is addressing the trepidation and disdain toward outlaw motorcycle gang behaviour that is commonplace in contemporary society. Beyond traditional criminal gang enterprise such as episodic inter-gang or more widespread violence and drug manufacture or distribution, a shift in sophistication by outlaw motorcycle gangs toward more diversified criminal enterprise has emerged. These ventures include money laundering and tactical collaboration with other crime groups and engagement with external expertise for example. Further, an expansion of legitimate business activity by outlaw motorcycle gangs which often enables other crime operations creates a more difficult landscape for legislators and law enforcement agencies to address outlaw motorcycle gang criminality. This has resulted in the emergence of populace anti-gang or anti-association type legal scaffolding to address these agents in the Australian criminal justice setting. However, the success or otherwise of these controversial legislative developments remains unclear as does the impact of law enforcement on domestic outlaw motorcycle gang criminality.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10611-018-9771-1","2018-02-24 11:30:26","53","Crime, Law and Social Change"

                  <p>Evidence supports the use of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) for well-being and behavior change among parents. This study examined the impact of a brief ACT intervention on positive parenting strategies, psychological flexibility, and distress among parents who have experienced relationship violence.As part of a larger study, 43 parents were recruited from a community outreach center and completed measures of parenting, ACT processes, and distress. Participants were pseudo-randomly assigned to either receive their treatment-as-usual (TAU) or ACT plus TAU. Twenty-five participants received four weekly sessions of ACT plus TAU, and 18 received TAU only. Positive parenting behaviors among parents in the ACT&thinsp;+&thinsp;TAU group improved immediately following treatment compared to the TAU group. Improvements were maintained six weeks following treatment. The hypothesis that psychological flexibility would mediate improvements was not supported.The present study provides initial, preliminary support for the secondary benefits of brief, broad ACT interventions for positive parenting behaviors among parents who have experienced relationship violence. Clinical implications for implementing ACT for parents who have experienced relationship violence and methodological limitations are discussed.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-9956-5","2018-02-26 05:16:21","29","Journal of Family Violence"

Although the CDA was originally created to protect children online, section 230 of the CDA has been interpreted by the courts to grant broad immunities to websites facilitating the sexual exploitation of children and adults alike. Through analyzing the genesis and evolution of the CDA, it becomes clear that court interpretations of Section 230 are starkly inconsistent with original Congressional intent, and that the primary way to avoid <em>de facto</em> decriminalization of Internet-facilitated commercial sexual exploitation is to amend the Communications Decency Act.</p>","http://digitalcommons.uri.edu/dignity/vol3/iss1/12","2018-02-26 12:31:17","29","Dignity: A Journal on Sexual Exploitation and Violence"

By comparing it with several radicalisationmodels, it was found that conversion and radicalisation processes have much in common. Based on thisobservation, the idea of a radical-conversion model is formulated. Subsequently, five hypotheses derived from theradical-conversion model are tested with a sample of foreign fighters database (n = 408). It was found that convertsand non-converts can be seen as equals. The convert&rsquo;s involvement in suicide missions and perceived trustworthinessare relatively the same as non-converts. However, due to certain predisposition factors, differences for rank,desertion, and the role of women were found. This Research Note suggests that there are strong indications thatradicalisation is a sub-type of conversion and that more research is needed on this topic.","http://www.terrorismanalysts.com/pt/index.php/pot/article/view/679","2018-02-27 10:16:58","52","Perspectives on Terrorism"
"9681","Terrorist Prison Breaks","Why would an insurgent group which employs terrorist tactics intentionally stage a quiet, nonviolent prisonbreak when it could instead carry out a violent spectacle? Insurgent targeting of prisons poses a puzzle to ourunderstanding of security in state-building environments, but it has yet to be explored. This article addresses thequestion of why terror groups choose to employ nonviolent means for a prison break with a comparative studyof prison break attempts in Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, and Nigeria. Using an original dataset consisting of allknown prison break attempts carried out by a terrorist organization between 2001 and 2015, this article discernsthe conditions under which nonviolent tactics are pursued. We argue that insurgents engage in nonviolent tacticswhen the predominant security authority signals the imminent withdrawal of military assets. This incentivizesthem to limit violent activity, thereby encouraging the completion of the withdrawal process.","http://www.terrorismanalysts.com/pt/index.php/pot/article/view/678","2018-02-27 10:16:58","30","Perspectives on Terrorism"
"9682","Terrorist Tactics By Criminal Organizations: the Mexican Case in Context","In the past 10 years in Mexico, more than 100,000 people have been killed in violence related to organized crime.Some attacks have left horrific scenes, meant to send messages to the public or government. Debate continues abouthow to characterize this violence, and some observers describe it as &ldquo;terrorism&rdquo; or its perpetrators as &ldquo;terrorists.&rdquo;This article emphasizes that Mexico has experienced terrorist tactics by criminal organizations. This implies thatwhile the perpetrators are better thought of (and dealt with) as criminal groups, some of their violence at leastpartially fulfills the criteria to be defined as terrorism. The use of terrorist tactics by criminal groups is an understudiedaspect of the crime-terror nexus because more research examines crime by terrorist groups. The articlediscusses three tactics seen in Mexico: bombings, violent communication, and attacks against politicians. It thenpresents comparable examples from other countries, such as Brazil, Colombia, Italy, and Russia. Similarities anddifferences between criminal groups and terrorist groups are discussed. The violence in Mexico is relatively uniquefor its scale, for the number of people killed, but in general the use of terrorist tactics by criminal organizations isnot new.","http://www.terrorismanalysts.com/pt/index.php/pot/article/view/677","2018-02-27 10:16:58","38","Perspectives on Terrorism"
"9683","Explaining Civilian Attacks: Terrorist Networks, Principal-Agent Problems and Target Selection","Terrorist groups exhibit variation in their targeting choices. Why do some groups direct their violence against civilianswhile others limit this occurrence? This study analyzes the network relationships between terrorist groups toelucidate their targeting behavior. Drawing upon insights from the organizational ecology and conflict literatures,we predict that terrorist group affiliates will be significantly more likely than their parent group to attack civiliantargets. Our original principal-agent theory consistently outperforms extant explanations in a multi-method analysisof 238 terrorist groups from 1998 to 2005. These results shed new light on why certain terrorist groups are morelikely than others to target civilians.","http://www.terrorismanalysts.com/pt/index.php/pot/article/view/676","2018-02-27 10:16:58","78","Perspectives on Terrorism"
"9684","Reconsidering Radicalization: Fanaticism and the Link Between Ideas and Violence","A central issue with many interpretations of radicalization remains their tendency to overemphasize the role ofextremist beliefs in motivating involvement in terrorism. After elaborating on this critique, the authors proposethat &lsquo;fanaticism&rsquo;, a concept developed by Taylor in the early 1990s, offers a way of overcoming this deficiency inradicalization-based approaches through its conditional understanding of when radical beliefs can lead to violentbehavior. Primary-sources driven empirical analysis supports both the critique of radicalization and the discussionof fanaticism&rsquo;s benefits. Results are relevant to both academics and counterterrorism practitioners working tounderstand the role of extremist beliefs in motivating involvement in terrorist violence.","http://www.terrorismanalysts.com/pt/index.php/pot/article/view/675","2018-02-27 10:16:58","28","Perspectives on Terrorism"

"9691","Situational Determinants of Enhanced Public View Monitor (epvm) Noticeability in Retail Environments: A Randomized Controlled Trial","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>External theft is a pervasive phenomenon, resulting in billions of dollars of lost revenue for US retailers each year (in: Retail Knowledge, Retail Fraud Survey, 2015, Volumatic, Norwich, <span>2015</span>). As retailer competition continues to stiffen, and profit margins decrease, retail loss practitioners have turned to situational crime prevention (SCP) techniques to proactively mitigate shoplifting. While repeated studies have demonstrated both the efficacy of Enhanced Public View Monitors (ePVMs) for minimizing deviant behavior, and positive return on investment (ROI) for this technology, there has been little research on how situational deployment factors influence the deterrent impact of these technologies. This study examines five situational deployment, or dosing, factors that may influence ePVM efficacy in a retail environment. Our results conclude display height and border color were significant factors influencing noticeability of ePVMs by offenders. Additionally, there was an interaction between display height and sound. Signage and blinking lights were not significant influences on noticeability. Our findings suggest that situational factors are important determinants of security technology noticeability in retail environments.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1057/s41284-018-0128-3","2018-02-27 15:17:23","19","Security Journal"

                  <p>This article revisits the framework which Buentello et al. (Prison J 71(2): 3&ndash;14, <span>1991</span>) created to describe the development of inmate solidarity groups into prison gangs in the Texas Department of Corrections. Interviews with current and former prison gang members in Texas, Arizona, and Illinois augment the current published literature on prison gangs in California. This article argues that the responses which prison administrations make to prisoners&rsquo; social orders are not static and have, in some cases, caused vertically configured groups to evolve into horizontally configured groups. These structural changes in prison gangs affect the gangs&rsquo; ability to affect control in the criminal underworld outside prison. Accordingly, although the challenges which prison administrations present to vertically developed social orders within prison may improve the administrations&rsquo; control within the prison walls, they may effectively decrease criminal-led social control on the street, leading to an increase in street-level violence.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12117-018-9332-0","2018-02-28 07:17:18","32","Trends in Organized Crime"

The concept of a â€œmarketized mentalityâ€ is introduced as a predictor of studentsâ€™ delinquency, along with an egoistic/competitive school cultureâ€”a feature of the school community. Five hypotheses pertaining to the readiness to use violence and self-reported delinquency were assessed using multilevel modeling with data from a survey in Germany for 4,150 students clustered in 69 schools. The results largely meet theoretical expectations. The measure of marketized mentality exhibits robust relationships with both forms of delinquency at the individual level, and an egoistic/competitive school culture helps explain variation in levels of these forms of delinquency across schools. Also consistent with expectations, the anti-social effects of marketized mentality are accentuated for both the readiness to use violence and committing instrumentally motivated property offenses as a competitive/egoistic school climate increases. The results of our analyses reveal that bringing in concepts of IAT can appreciably enhance understanding of the characteristics of students and features of communal school organization that are conducive to youthful offending.","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1111%2F1745-9125.12173","2018-03-01 06:30:49","47","Criminology"

                  <p>The development of the criminal sanctioning track in the EU is a prominent policy issue. Studies of the actual use of criminal sanctions in the member states are very important since the gap between the law and practice can be very wide. Policy makers and law enforcers are confronted with a lack of empirical data on the actual use of criminal law to sanction environmental offenses. In this paper, we use information stored in the <em>Environmental LawForce</em> database, which is a database of environmental sanctioning by criminal courts in Flanders, Belgium. The study distinguishes three types of offenders: companies, individuals prosecuted for acts committed as part of their professional activities, and individuals prosecuted for acts committed as part of their private lives. Based on previous theoretical insights, we investigate when we expect the environmental sanctions to be similar or different across the three groups of offenders. In particular, we assess the differences and similarities across the sanctioning of environmental offenses committed by companies, professional individuals and private individuals in Flanders.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10611-018-9772-0","2018-03-01 07:45:28","44","Crime, Law and Social Change"

                  <span>
                    <h3>Objectives</h3>
                    <p>To determine the contributions of period effects (controlling for ages and cohorts) and cohort effects (controlling for ages and periods) to the changes in the homicide arrest rates in the United States over the time span from 1965 to 2015.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>This determination faces the age&ndash;period&ndash;cohort identification problem: the linear trends of these three factors are linearly dependent and there are an infinite number of solutions that fit the data equally well. I address this problem in multiple ways: by setting reasonable bounds around the age-distribution of homicide arrests using constrained estimates, presenting estimable functions that are identified, and by using an age&ndash;period&ndash;cohort&ndash;characteristic model.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>The cohort effects on homicide arrest rates have <em>on average</em> trended upward since the cohort born in 1945&ndash;1949; and the period coefficients have <em>on average</em> trended downward since 1965, but trended upward during the mid-1960s to the early-1970s. These trends over time are somewhat different depending on the bounds under consideration.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>Theories that posit period effects as responsible for at least part of the drop in homicide rates from 1990 to 2015 and the increase in homicide rates from the mid-1960s to the early-1970 are consistent with this analysis. Cohort effects worked in the opposite direction of the period effects for the years from 1990 to 2015. The existence of both sets of effects has implications for criminological theories and for policy prescriptions.</p>

"9742","The Dynamic of General Compliance With the Oecd Anti-Bribery Convention: Two Interpretative Approaches","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>The way in which people understand the dynamic of signatories&rsquo; enforcement of the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention determines the way in which they formulate policy recommendations, and a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic of signatories&rsquo; Convention enforcement demands the coordination of two different analytic approaches&mdash;the rational-choice approach and the institutional approach. The popular rational-choice approach in current literature highlights the &ldquo;under-enforcement&rdquo; problem of the Convention, assumes the decisive influence of signatories&rsquo; self-seeking nature on Convention enforcement, and seeks to identify the structural failure of the anti-bribery collaboration which generates unsatisfactory cost-benefit calculations and encourages signatories to shirk. While a branch of the rational-choice account converges on the failure of the existing monitoring system in deterring free riders by borrowing wisdom from cooperation theories, it fails to illustrate that the anti-bribery collaboration by its very nature is incompatible with a centralized monitoring approach&mdash;a conventional effective solution to cooperation dilemmas. To fill this gap, Part I &amp; II of this study lays bare the incompatibility of a centralized monitoring approach with the anti-bribery collaboration based on the findings of current rational-choice account and frames a decentralized monitoring system as an alternative. On the other hand, Part III of this study argues that another face of the dynamic of Convention enforcement&mdash;the developmental reality in leading jurisdictions, is also noteworthy. An institutional approach which highlights the relevance of favorable domestic institutional contexts to robust Convention enforcement is proposed as a counterpart to the rational-choice approach. By analyzing the case of the SEC&rsquo;s increasingly zealous enforcement of the FCPA in the US during the period from the 1980s to the 2000s, this study concludes that local agencies&rsquo; adherence to other official duties in an ever-evolving institutional context may result in an effect of &ldquo;unconscious enforcement&rdquo; of anti-bribery laws.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10611-018-9768-9","2018-03-01 17:15:27","35","Crime, Law and Social Change"

"9745","Religion and Desistance From Substance Use Among Adolescent Offenders: the Role of Cognitive Functioning","Background
Religious beliefs and practices have been shown to have some association with desistance from offending, as have cognitive processes, including emotion regulation, self-control, reasoning, learning, and empathy. Religious behaviours may, however, be moderated or mediated by cognitive abilities, but few studies take this into account.


Aim
The aim of this study was to assess the role of cognitive ability in any relationship between religious beliefs and behaviours and desistance from substance use among adolescents.


Method
Data were extracted from the Pathways to Desistance Study dataset (nÂ =Â 1,354). Religious measures were self-rated importance of religion, helpfulness of religion in dealing with problems, and attendance at religious services. Cognitive measures were the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence and Trail Making Tests. A count of numbers of mind-altering substances used constituted the main substance measure. Control variables included sex, age, and age of onset of offending.


Results
Mixed-effects longitudinal analyses revealed that religious behaviours did constitute a significant predictor of lower substance use for young people after a criminal conviction, after controlling for changes in employment, social support, and delinquent peer association, but only among those with average or above cognitive function.


Conclusions
These findings may explain why there have been some discrepancies in previous studies of religion and substance misuse. They may also have important implications for the training of anyone delivering programmes to young people in prison that have faith-based elements, including community faith group leaders and volunteers.","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fcbm.2071","2018-03-02 02:45:33","41","Criminal Behaviour and Mental Health"

                  <span>
                    <h3>Purpose</h3>
                    <p>The Prison Project is a nationwide prospective cohort study examining the development of criminal behavior and other life circumstances before, during, and after detention in the Netherlands.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>The target population of the study consisted of all men, aged 18&ndash;65&nbsp;years, and born in the Netherlands, who entered pre-trial detention between October 2010 and April 2011. Participants were questioned repeatedly during detention and six and 24&nbsp;months after release. Self-reported information on a variety of topics was collected at each measurement, including demographics, lifestyle, personality traits, self-control, attitudes towards criminal justice actors, experiences during detention, and different life domains (i.e., recidivism, employment, financial and housing situation, health, family situation, social networks). Moreover, detailed longitudinal information was gathered from different official registration systems.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>In total, 1904 men participated in the baseline interview. Of those qualifying for an interview six and 24&nbsp;months after release, 53% and 56% were successfully interviewed. Analyses show that&mdash;at each measurement&mdash;respondents&rsquo; characteristics are almost identical to those of the total target population.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>Findings of the Prison Project illustrate the value of having longitudinal data to disentangle possible causal relationships. Results of the Prison Project will contribute to more knowledge on life-course criminology and more effective treatment of offenders by the criminal justice system.</p>

Modernity rationalizes the self and tends to ignore emotions, which can result in the total hiding of humiliation leads to vengeance. This essay outlines a theory of the social-emotional world implied in the work of C. H. Cooley, whose concept of the &ldquo;looking-glass self&rdquo; can be used as antidote to the assumptions of modernity: the self is based on &ldquo;living in the mind&rdquo; of others, resulting in feeling either pride or shame. This essay proposes that the complete hiding of shame can lead to feedback loops with no natural limit.

Most prominently, studies of weak quality produced larger effect sizes. Unexpectedly, non-established treatments had more effect than did established treatments, which may be explained by the use of less rigorous study designs. Treatment groups with a higher percentage of juveniles with similar age victims or mixed type problem behavior also yielded larger effect sizes. Lastly, evaluation of treatment effects by professionals produced higher effect sizes, compared to other sources of information (e.g., adolescent self-report). Although only a marginal to no indication was found for publication bias by means of funnel plot analysis of the distribution of effect sizes, articles published in peer reviewed journals showed relatively large effect sizes.

In this article, we provide an updated theoretical account of cognitive distortions in males &ndash; the Multi-Mechanism Theory of Cognitive Distortions (MMT-CD). Adopting a dual-process perspective, and incorporating the concept of motivated cognition and the effects of visceral factors, we propose that cognitive distortions arise from three mechanisms, which can be identified in terms of their temporal occurrence to an offense. <italic>Mechanism I</italic> accounts for cognitive distortions that arise long before an offense is committed but serve to influence an individual's life-course and goals in a way that brings them closer eventually sexually offending. <italic>Mechanism II</italic> accounts for distortions that arise in the lead up to or immediately before a sexual offense, thus, providing a justification for committing an offense. <italic>Mechanism III</italic> accounts for distortions that are formed post-offense as a result of the adversarial context of the individual's social environment.

                    <p>In 2011, Silk Road became the first black market, or ""cryptomarket"", for illicit drugs. This study examines two of the largest cryptomarkets which have operated, Silk Road 2.0 and Agora Marketplace. We hypothesize that cryptomarkets cater to buyers who intend to resell or redistribute the products, specifically in the form of social drug dealing, and that larger quantities will be purchased on the cryptomarkets over time. We examine these hypotheses through a descriptive and qualitative assessment of the distribution of drugs sold, and an estimated trend line based on simple linear regression. Data was collected using a custom web crawler which was supplemented with a dataset collected by independent researcher Gwern Branwen, community members and researchers in total spanning the period from February 28th 2014 to April 2015. The observed demand was primarily for quantities intended for personal use or social drug dealing. The majority of sales fell within the lower price ranges, although a significant part of the revenue was generated in price ranges that suggested business-to-business dealing. Furthermore, we found that the sizes of the purchases decreased significantly in both the case of Silk Road 2.0 and Agora Marketplace. The results suggest that cryptomarkets resemble traditional drug markets in terms of the distribution and revenues. As such, it is relevant to include cryptomarkets in discussions about potential reductions of the harmful social consequences of drug markets, as well as in general discussions about drug markets and drug trafficking.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12117-016-9281-4","2018-03-03 02:17:30","71","Trends in Organized Crime"

                    <p>Organized crime has long captured the attention of media, with books, movies, television, and the press offering different representations of what organized crime is. These representations tend to vary in different countries according to the specific coverage and reporting preferences of local media. The ways in which organized crime is framed by the media is of great importance, as mediated images of organized crime may have powerful effects on both the general public and policy-makers. The narrative presented, however, might be distorted and not fully correspond to the notion of organized crime as framed by academic communities. Particularly in the Italian scenario, scholarly definitions and narratives around organized crime have evolved and have been refined meaningfully over the years, presenting a complex, multi-layered, and diversified criminal panorama. Several studies have recently addressed press representations of Italian organized crime in the foreign press. However, the way in which the Italian press has represented the changing rhetoric on organized crime has so far been under-investigated. This research presents the results of a longitudinal media analysis of a selection of Italian newspapers, which aims to inspect the ways in which the press has represented the threats posed by organized crime over time.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12117-016-9270-7","2018-03-03 02:17:30","48","Trends in Organized Crime"

                  <p>Organized crime groups (OCGs) fight against each other even if it harms their businesses and exposes them to law enforcement authorities. Why do some groups refrain from fighting, while others operate in the incessantly violent underworld? To explain this puzzle, we propose that the underworld conflict is related to the strategies of extra-legal governance adopted by OCGs. We suggest that such strategies have origins in the availability of resources within the groups reach at their entrance into the underworld. More specifically, OCGs with access to easily extractable resources develop limited governance, which leaves them vulnerable to internal and external challenges. OCGs without access to easily extractable resources invest in extended governance, reducing their risk of underworld conflict. This article illustrates this hypothesis in the comparative case study of the Colombian organized crime, supported by new quantitative data.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12117-018-9330-2","2018-03-04 07:17:24","57","Trends in Organized Crime"

In general, a gendered strength-based treatment model involves a collaborative process that builds upon positive skills and provides options to utilize those skills to fulfill unmet needs.

                  <p>Pratt and Turanovic (<em>European Journal of Criminology, 13</em>(1):129&ndash;146, <span>2016</span>) argue that previous studies operationalizing risky lifestyles as mere &ldquo;going out&rdquo; (problematic indicators of risky lifestyles) were misspecified and that &ldquo;improved&rdquo; indicators of risky lifestyle (risky behaviors) would perform better than &ldquo;problematic&rdquo; indicators in models that explain victimization. This study examines these propositions by testing the self-control/lifestyle framework of victimization using the data from a random sample of Filipino high school students at a state university in Dumaguete City, Philippines. Results show strong support to Pratt and Turanovic&rsquo;s claims. Self-control has stronger effects on improved indicators than on problematic ones. And, improved indicators have stronger effects than problematic indicators on property, violent, peer/sibling and sexual victimization. Moreover, the findings provide partial support for the self-control/lifestyle framework of victimization.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11417-018-9265-1","2018-03-05 07:15:12","41","Asian Journal of Criminology"

                  <p>Although one of the more understudied sexual paraphilias, as an increasing number of cases are reported, it becomes pertinent to revisit academic analyses of necrophilia, particularly those attempts at classifying necrophilic behaviour. A case study is presented here of the development and enactment of necrophilic desire to determine the most appropriate means of categorising necrophilic behaviours. The study finds that until a stronger cohort of offenders can be established, a broader classification tool is preferable to excessive subdivisions of behaviour in grouping and understanding necrophilic activities, with the addendum that necrophiles can display a range of behaviours at any one time. Directions for law enforcement and clinicians are offered whilst the literature base is expanded.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9259-z","2018-03-06 09:16:48","33","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"
"9804","The Impact of Childhood Abuse on Adult Male Prisoners: A Systematic Review","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>Childhood abuse has been associated with a broad range of adverse cognitive, emotional, behavioural and social outcomes. Research specific to adult male prisoners indicates an association between childhood abuse experiences and crime recidivism, mental health issues, substance abuse and interpersonal difficulties. The purpose of this review was to conduct a systematic investigation of databases, using predetermined search strategies and key terms, in order to collate and describe the current literature examining the impact childhood abuse has on the functioning of adult males incarcerated for criminal offences. The investigation yielded 217 studies, which, through further analysis, was reduced to a total of 17 peer-reviewed articles. A narrative synthesis summary of findings was subsequently carried out. The findings identified four main themes, revealing the means by which childhood abuse impacts the functioning of adult male prisoners: mental health difficulties, crime and recidivism, substance use and behaviour/personality issues. In addition, less robust themes of revictimisation and adult life functional difficulties were revealed. Lastly, the noteworthy limitations of the collated research and the clinical implications for the findings were discussed.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9260-6","2018-03-06 09:16:49","65","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"

                  <p>The first aim of the present study was to assess the effect of stereotype threat on recall of a visual event involving cars by female witnesses. It was expected that stereotyped women (by the interviewer) would provide a poorer description of the cars involved than non-stereotyped women. The second aim was to test if a modified cognitive interview (MCI) could reduce this negative effect. We expected that MCI reduce the harmful effect of stereotype threat on women&rsquo;s recall in comparison with a control interview (CI). Sixty-nine women watched a videotape of a criminal event involving cars. Two days later, they had to recall the to-be-remembered event and were given either a neutral or a threatening (= stereotyping) instruction. They were then interviewed using a CI or an MCI. Results showed that threatened women were less accurate and made more errors and confabulations than non-threatened women. They also produced more incorrect details about the cars involved. Moreover, the MCI elicited more correct details but without impairing accuracy for both threatened and non-threatened women. Our study supports the existing evidence that women&rsquo;s testimony may be affected by the social context and highlights the need to use the MCI during judicial interviews.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9261-5","2018-03-07 06:16:57","24","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"
"9822","Force, Stress, and Decision-Making Within the Belgian Police: the Impact of Stressful Situations on Police Decision-Making","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>Stress and fear are inevitable aspects of the police job and may have a large impact on police officers&rsquo; decision-making process. Many studies have explored how stress and fear may influence assessments of police officers, especially with regard to the use of force. This article aims to contribute to this research domain by reporting the findings from two empirical studies among Belgian police officers: a quantitative study of police officers&rsquo; attitudes towards and experiences with the use of force and a qualitative study on the influence of stress and emotions on officers&rsquo; decision-making and assessment abilities and accuracy of shooting. Both studies confirmed that stress and fear are often present in Belgian police practice. One of the main findings is that Belgian police officers are anxious about the consequences of their actions because they know they will be held accountable for them. The pressure that results from this accountability can make it even more difficult for police officers to react to stressful situations. Therefore, we need to look for the right balance in this difficult position, by providing tools that support police officers in making daily decisions, and help them do their job as effectively as possible.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9262-4","2018-03-07 06:16:57","28","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"

Many factors predicting DV have been already identified; however, few papers presented the predicting power of those factors. Therefore, this study aims to identify the power of family- and community-related factors in predicting the perpetration and victimization of DV and to determine the strongest risk factors using a meta-analysis. Through a rigorous search procedure, a total of 131 correlates of DV perpetrators and 139 correlates of DV victims were identified in 27 studies. The results showed that &ldquo;having deviant peers&rdquo; was the strongest risk factor of DV perpetration, whereas &ldquo;witnessing parental violence&rdquo; was the strongest risk factor of DV victimization. Also, we found that the risk factors were more powerful predictors of DV perpetrators and victims than were the protective factors. Findings from this study provided valuable evidence to identify DV victimization and perpetration, and to develop intervention strategies preventing DV.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS1359178917302446%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D8b3cfc21bad9fb3364291486561bb6e4","2018-03-07 23:45:09","42","Aggression and Violent Behavior"

"9838","Exploring the Efficacy of Reintegrative Shaming For Non-Predatory Offending","Background
Since Braithwaite advanced reintegrative shaming theory about 25Â years ago, the theory has almost invariably been retested only in relation to predatory offending. Few studies have tested the relevance of the theory for non-predatory offending.


Aim
This study aims to explore the utility of reintegrative shaming theory in explaining non-predatory crimes. Our main research question was: is acknowledgement of shame apportioned by others associated with reduction in non-predatory offending?


Methods
We used zero-inflated negative binomial modelling to analyse data from a national, longitudinal, population-based study of 1,726 adolescents.


Results
Overall, peer shame acknowledgement at age 18â€“21 was a significant predictor of no non-predatory offending at ages 21â€“27. Contrary to our expectation, however, similar recognition and incorporation of parental shame was not related to absence of such offending.


Implications
Our findings add further weight to the validity of reintegrative shaming theory, showing its broader value explaining criminal behaviourâ€”and desistance from itâ€”beyond the original model.","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fcbm.2072","2018-03-08 06:30:34","75","Criminal Behaviour and Mental Health"

In particular, it examined the extent to which these adolescents exhibit high levels of internalizing and externalizing symptoms as consequences of such exposure, and the extent to which self-efficacy and collective efficacy moderate these consequences. A systematic random sample of 760 Palestinian adolescents in Israel (320 boys, and 440 girls) filled out a self-administered questionnaire. The results show that most of the adolescents had witnessed community violence during the last year and during lifetime, and more than one third had directly experienced such violence during their lifetime compared with 19.6% during the last year. Boys were exposed to community violence more often than girls. Moreover, participants' ECV predicted high levels of externalizing and internalizing symptoms. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that collective efficacy moderated the correlation between experiencing community violence and internalizing symptoms, whereas self-efficacy moderated the correlation between witnessing community violence and externalizing symptoms. There is a need for providing support for youth from close adults as well as from formal and informal resources in the community before and after their ECV.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213418300334%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Db6a24fb45ebb90477c4e6c7812d5b95c","2018-03-08 10:15:17","59","Child Abuse and Neglect"

The current study used latent class analysis to examine the existence of different childhood maltreatment and household dysfunction typologies in a sample of U.S. military veterans identified through the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions-III ((NESARC-III)). A total of 60.73% of veterans reported one or more ACEs. Four latent classes were identified and were named <italic>Low adversities</italic>, <italic>Moderate maltreatment with high household substance use</italic>, <italic>Severe maltreatment with moderate household dysfunction</italic> and <italic>Severe multi-type adversities</italic>. Relative to the <italic>Low adversities</italic> class, the three maltreatment/dysfunction classes had significantly elevated odds ratios (1.72&ndash;2.29) for adult incarceration, when controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and alcohol and drug use. The results point to the importance of examining childhood risk factors for incarceration and suggest that a certain sub-group of military personnel who are about to transition into the civilian life may need additional support to adjust and live successful lives.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213418300358%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D2bf9ddff75b08d4a16cf7da49a56df84","2018-03-08 10:15:17","44","Child Abuse and Neglect"

These children are often victims of traumas and adverse life events. This article aimed to investigate traumas experienced by street children and their coping and resilience strategies used to deal with adversities in a logic of survival, relying on a mixed method approach. A group of 176 street children, aged 7&ndash;18 (n&#8239;=&#8239;21 girls), recruited in Port-au-Prince, completed measures assessing PTSD, social support and resilience. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to document traumatic experiences, factors related to resilience and coping strategies. After performing statistical analyses to evaluate prevalence and predictors associated with PTSD, and level of social support satisfaction and resilience, qualitative analysis using a grounded theory approach was conducted. Results showed that street children experienced multiple traumas such as neglect, maltreatment, psychological, physical and sexual abuse. However, they also showed self-efficacy to face their traumatic experiences and few of them (less than 15%) obtained scores reaching clinical rates of PTSD, while a large majority presented a level of resilience between moderate to very high. A socio-ecological model of multiple traumas and a model of coping, survival and resilience strategies are conceptualized. Data provide a better understanding of the traumas experienced by street children, their coping and resilience strategies. Results underscore ways to develop practices to offer psychological support, social and vocational integration based on the real needs of these children, in a perspective of social justice.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS014521341830036X%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D26ca20a142767df9be1f7efe532efedd","2018-03-08 10:15:17","90","Child Abuse and Neglect"

For HIV-infected adolescents and youth, such impacts may include onward transmission of HIV. To evaluate this possibility, the current study measured the burden of childhood adversity and its influence on risky health behaviors among perinatally-infected adolescents and youth. We surveyed 250 perinatally-infected adolescents and youth (13&ndash;24 years) receiving care in Soweto, South Africa. Both male and female participants reported on childhood adversity (using the ACE-IQ), sexual behavior, and psychosocial state. Viral load was also abstracted from their charts. We used logistic regressions to test the association between cumulative adversity and behavioral outcomes. Half the sample reported eight or more adversities. Overall, 72% experienced emotional abuse, 59% experienced physical abuse, 34% experienced sexual abuse, 82% witnessed domestic violence, and 91% saw someone being attacked in their community. A clear gradient emerged between cumulative adversities and behavioral risk. Having experienced one additional childhood adversity raised the odds of risky sexual behavior by almost 30% (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.09&ndash;1.48). Viral suppression was poor overall (31% had viral loads &amp;gt;400&#8239;copies/ml), but was not related to adversity. Adversity showed a robust relationship to depression and substance abuse. Childhood adversity is common, influences the current health of HIV-positive adolescents and youth, and puts their sexual partners at risk for HIV infection. Greater primary prevention of childhood adversity and increased access to support services (e.g., mental health) could reduce risk taking among HIV-positive adolescents and youth.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213418300541%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Df1fb25d4a42d7f43be0d7dd9a411bbb2","2018-03-08 10:15:18","30","Child Abuse and Neglect"

The objective of this study was to examine the association between suicidal thoughts and self-harming behavior and referral for mental health services among children involved in the Child Welfare System in Ontario, Canada. Data for this study were obtained from the Ontario Incidence Study of Reported Child Abuse and Neglect 2013. An estimate 57,798 child maltreatment investigations was analyzed using binary logistic regression with referral for mental health service as the outcome variable. Of the 57,798 cases, 4709 (8.1%), were referred for mental health services. More than seven out of ten maltreated children who engaged in self-harming behavior and two out of three maltreated children who expressed suicidal thoughts were not referred for mental health services. In the multivariate logistic regression model, children who expressed suicidal thoughts had 2.39 times higher odds of being referred for mental health services compared to children with no suicidal thoughts (AOR&#8239;=&#8239;2.39, 99% C.I. 2.05&ndash;2.77) and children who engaged in self-harming behavior had 1.44 times higher odds of being referred for mental health services compared to children who did not engage in self-harming behavior (AOR&#8239;=&#8239;1.44, 99% C.I. 1.24&ndash;1.67), both after controlling for child demographic characteristics, maltreatment characteristics, and child functioning concerns. Given that referral is the initial step towards mental health service utilization, it is important that child welfare workers receive the necessary training so as to carefully assess and refer children in care who expressed suicidal thoughts or engaged in self-harming behavior for appropriate mental health services.

Limited, primarily international research suggests that child welfare clients have mixed feelings about Child Protective Services (CPS) and that fear of CPS may present a barrier to care. Understanding how pregnant opioid-using women in substance abuse treatment perceive CPS may be useful in encouraging substance abuse treatment initiation. Participants were currently or recently (within past 12 months) pregnant women with current or recent (within past 12 months) abuse/dependence of pharmaceutical opioids at a drug treatment facility. Participants were recruited by treatment staff to participate in a comprehensive study across multiple domains. Data for this analysis were collected using semi-structured qualitative interviews. Transcribed data were thematically analyzed using in vivo and interpretive coding by three coders for purposes of inter-rater reliability. Following 2, two-hour meetings, consensus was reached on primary themes and sub-themes. Two major themes and several sub-themes were identified: 1) Participants&rsquo; feelings and attitudes about CPS (positive and negative); 2) Interaction-based perceptions of CPS&rsquo; function and performance. Participants&rsquo; feelings toward CPS were often conditioned by their experiences with individual caseworkers. While many pregnant, opioid-using women identify legitimate, and even useful features of CPS, fear of CPS can be a barrier to care. Making substance abuse treatment accessible to this population requires recognition of their complex feelings toward CPS, and coordination among CPS case workers and substance abuse treatment providers.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213418300528%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Dfb59907115d2fe0e9a956e939235b2ae","2018-03-08 10:15:18","29","Child Abuse and Neglect"

We determined the frequency and injury patterns in children who underwent child abuse consultation after IPV exposure by retrospectively analyzing the ""Examination of Siblings To Recognize Abuse"" cohort of children referred for physical abuse. Children were selected who presented after IPV exposure. Among 2890 children evaluated by child abuse pediatricians, 61 (2.1%) patients presented after IPV exposure. Of the 61, 11 (18.0%) were exposed to IPV, but had no direct involvement in the IPV event, 36 (59.0%) sustained inadvertent trauma during IPV, and 14 (23.0%) were directly assaulted during IPV. Thirty-six patients (59.0%) had an injury: 31 (51.0%) had cutaneous injuries and 15 (24.6%) had internal injuries including fracture(s), intracranial or intra-abdominal injury. Of the 15 patients with internal injuries, 14 (93.3%) were less than 12 months old. Among the 36 patients with injuries, 16 (44.4%) had no report of direct injury, a report of a mechanism that did not explain the identified injuries, or a report of trauma without a specific mechanism. Five (13.9%) did not have physical examination findings to suggest the extent of their internal injuries. Injuries are present in a significant proportion of children presenting to Emergency Departments after IPV exposure. History and physical examination alone are insufficient to detect internal injuries especially in infants.

The present study investigated whether dissociation mediates the effect of exposure to physical or sexual child abuse on intimate partner violence in adulthood. We tested this using prospective data collected from birth to age 32 from 80 female participants in the Minnesota Longitudinal Study of Risk and Adaptation. We found that women who experienced sexual or physical abuse during the first 17.5 years of life (<italic>n</italic>&#8239;=&#8239;37) were more likely (<italic>r</italic>&#8239;=&#8239;0.30, <italic>p</italic>&#8239;&amp;lt;&#8239;.01) to experience intimate partner violence in adulthood (ages 20&ndash;32). Furthermore, we found that dissociation partially mediated this effect. Specifically, exposure to childhood abuse predicted greater dissociation in late adolescence (age 19), which in turn predicted more intimate partner violence during early to mid-adulthood. The results of this study highlight the mediating role played by dissociation in the revictimization of women abused during childhood, and speak to the need to develop interventions designed to prevent intimate partner violence among abused girls or adult women with a history of abuse.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213418300607%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Df58b9b9fe7e9210690e79f791e7536b6","2018-03-08 10:15:18","39","Child Abuse and Neglect"

We conducted a systematic review to investigate whether there are gender differences in the effects of maltreatment on adult depression and anxiety. Medline, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Lilacs were searched for relevant studies published up to May 2016. Eligible studies included population-based studies (with a cohort, case-control or cross-sectional design) which assessed maltreatment during childhood or adolescence (&le;18 years) and its association with major depression or generalized anxiety disorder (DSM/ICD diagnostic criteria) in adulthood (&amp;gt;18 years) separately for females and males. Meta-analysis was performed to estimate the association between each exposure and outcome using fixed and random effects models. Pooled odds ratios (OR) were estimated separately for women and men and compared. Five studies of physical and sexual abuse were included in the meta-analyses. These provided twenty-two effects sizes estimates (11 for men, 11 for women) for associations between physical/sexual abuse and depression/anxiety. Exposure to each kind of abuse increased the odds of depression/anxiety. Associations were larger for women than for men, however, these gender differences were not statistically significant.

This is a critical gap given that callousness is a robust predictor of serious aggressive and violent behavior. We examine the association between substantiated maltreatment events in childhood and adolescence (up to age 13) and conduct problems and lack of guilt at age 14. We analyze self- and parent-report data along with official maltreatment records on 557 youth (50% female; 69% non-white) from a larger dataset (Longitudinal Studies on Childhood Abuse and Neglect; <italic>N</italic>&#8239;=&#8239;1354). Results of multinomial logistic regression models indicate that youth with histories of substantiated maltreatment events are more likely to have elevated conduct problems and decreased guilt at age 14, particularly if they experienced maltreatment before the age of four years old. Youth who exhibit conduct problems and also appear to lack guilt are more likely to have a personal history of substantiated maltreatment. We discuss our results in terms of their implications for theory and practice.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213418300589%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D507bad68f5c7d183ab3dc0c7b9e399ed","2018-03-08 10:15:18","27","Child Abuse and Neglect"

Willingness was examined through two terms: reluctance&mdash; the level of unwillingness or disinclination to disclose, and urge&mdash;the need to share in order to get rid of unbearable feelings. The sample consisted of 3,156 boys (n&#8239;=&#8239;1,544) and girls (n&#8239;=&#8239;1,612) between the ages of 11&ndash;16 who reported having been abused at least once during their life. Participants were divided into three groups: experiencing other than CSA, sexual abuse with no physical contact, and sexual abuse with physical contact. Regarding measures, a self-report questionnaire incorporating the following instruments was administered: Demographics, the Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire (JVQ), and the Disclosure of Trauma Questionnaire (DTQ). Study results indicated that CSA victims were more reluctant to disclose than victims of other than CSA forms of abuse. The more severe the CSA (physical contact) the lower was the willingness to disclose. Boys were more reluctant than girls to disclose sexual abuse whether or not it involved physical contact. Reluctance to disclose was positively associated with emotional reactions to disclosure while urge to talk was negatively correlated with emotional reactions to disclosure.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213418300747%26_version%3D1%26md5%3De8bef65db751472624658e2283f9c0de","2018-03-08 10:15:18","33","Child Abuse and Neglect"

While retrospective self-report is convenient to use in studies assessing the impact of maltreatment on perinatal outcomes, it may be vulnerable to bias. We assessed bias in reporting of maltreatment with respect to women&rsquo;s experiences of adverse perinatal outcomes in a cohort of 230 women enrolled in studies of maternal mental illness. Each woman provided a self-reported history of childhood maltreatment via the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire at two time points: 1) the preconception or prenatal period and 2) the postpartum period. While most women&rsquo;s reports of maltreatment agreed, there was less agreement for physical neglect among women experiencing adverse perinatal outcomes. Further, among women who discrepantly reported maltreatment, those experiencing adverse pregnancy outcomes tended to report physical neglect after delivery but not before, and associations between physical neglect measured after delivery and adverse pregnancy outcomes were larger than associations that assessed physical neglect before delivery. There were larger associations between post-delivery measured maltreatment and perinatal outcomes among women who had not previously been pregnant and in those with higher postpartum depressive symptoms. Although additional larger studies in the general population are necessary to replicate these findings, they suggest retrospective reporting of childhood maltreatment, namely physical neglect, may be prone to systematic differential recall bias with respect to perinatal outcomes. Measures of childhood maltreatment reported before delivery may be needed to validly estimate associations between maternal exposure to childhood physical neglect and perinatal outcomes.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213418300346%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D4482e134cf8bed51f2dd917e024568f3","2018-03-08 10:15:18","30","Child Abuse and Neglect"

To date, a synthesis of available survey instruments and their quality has not been published, despite the existence of several instruments measuring digital dating abuse in young people's relationships. This paper describes existing instruments and their characteristics. A review of the literature from 1990 to 2016 revealed at least 17 different terms representing the digital dating abuse construct, 22 instruments measuring the phenomenon of which 16 were included in this review, and few clearly defined constructs. Definitional inconsistencies suggest that the instruments may measure various constructs including aggression and abuse, although this remains unclear. Eleven of the 16 instruments reported psychometric properties, at times limited to reliability evidence. This review highlights the need for delineation between aggressive and abusive digital dating behaviours, stringency in defining the digital dating abuse construct, and the development of a robust measurement instrument that yields both reliability and validity evidence.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS1359178917300368%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D6f460f20d541ec26d9b29fcf43ddf475","2018-03-08 23:45:10","45","Aggression and Violent Behavior"

                  <p>Prisons have been described as the final frontier for research on gangs and gang members. Criminological research in prisons is rare due to restricted access to facilities, concerns about harsh public scrutiny, and worries about security. There are added challenges for survey research involving prison gang members, as it is believed that gang norms inhibit reliable and valid responses and discourage participation in research. This article introduces the Study of Trajectories, Associations, and Reentry&mdash;the LoneStar Project&mdash;which involved interview-based surveys with 802 prison inmates in Texas, over 45% of whom were officially classified as gang members. We assess the prospect for conducting interview-based survey research with gang members in prison. We detail the planning and implementation phases of this study, assess whether gang members can be surveyed in prisons with fidelity, report descriptive statistics on gang and non-gang members, and identify five key operational lessons from this study. Our results revealed that gang members would not only participate in research, but that the methodological characteristics of their survey responses were indistinguishable statistically and substantively from those of non-gang prison inmates. We also determined that strong researcher-practitioner relationships, a nimble yet consistent research team, and a heavy emphasis on rapport building allowed this project to be carried out with few disruptions in a prison environment. These results are promising for future research in prisons, especially with gang members.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12117-018-9331-1","2018-03-09 01:17:31","102","Trends in Organized Crime"

Using the data from one district in Seoul, Korea, we ran a series of Poisson regression models with interaction terms allowed for articulating the conditional effects of CCTVs on crime. In line with studies in Western countries, CCTVs in Korea were significantly associated with levels of property crime and the areas with larger surveillance zones had lower property crime levels. Also, there was a conditional crime reduction effect of CCTVs on assaults, depending on the areal density of alcohol outlets. The conditional effect of CCTVs suggests some neighborhood characteristics optimize the deployment of CCTVs, which guide more effective implementation of CCTV systems for crime control and prevention.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS1756061617303476%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Da9a0e11c04d33892a0294423727990d5","2018-03-09 12:01:12","40","International Journal of Law, Crime and Justice"

                  <p>While psychometric police selection processes have progressively evolved, the efficacy of simple background information has not been extensively evaluated. This study examined the utility of base rate information to predict job performance among law enforcement officers. Pre-employment historical markers from bad hires were compared to good hires from a large sample of 1536 officers. Of this sample, 205 officers were categorized as bad hires if they were arrested, had greater than five misconduct episodes, or were terminated for cause within 5&nbsp;years following hire. Base rates of 40 pre-employment history variables were compared for good and bad hires. Analysis of markers showed that bad hires had a significantly higher frequency of markers across family factors, mental health variables, conduct problems, and criminal justice outcomes compared to good hires. Among the largest differences were history of multiple physical altercations, outpatient psychiatric treatment, and events related to previous law enforcement employment such as employer reprimands, suspensions, or fitness for duty evaluations. Many other intuitive markers occurred too infrequently to analyze or showed no significant difference between good hires and bad hires in law enforcement settings. Base rates in addition to psychological test data are necessary aspects of the police pre-employment evaluation.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9258-0","2018-03-10 08:31:45","108","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"

The aims of the current study were: 1) to test indicators of size (number of friends) and fragmentation (number of connections between friends) of maltreated young adults&rsquo; online networks as predictors of intentional and unintentional exposure to sexual content and offline high-risk sexual behavior and 2) to test maltreatment as a moderator of these associations. Participants were selected from a longitudinal study on the effects of child maltreatment (n&#8239;=&#8239;152; Mean age 21.84 years). Data downloaded from Facebook were used to calculate network variables of size (number of friends), density (connections between friends), average degree (average number of connections for each friend), and percent isolates (those not connected to others in the network). Self-reports of intentional and unintentional exposure to online sexual content and offline high-risk sexual behavior were the outcome variables. Multiple-group path modeling showed that only for the maltreated group having a higher percent of isolates in the network predicted intentional exposure to online sexual content and offline high-risk sexual behavior. An implication of this finding is that the composition of the Facebook network may be used as a risk indicator for individuals with child-welfare documented maltreatment experiences.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213418300590%26_version%3D1%26md5%3De956d2363d9cc56df0d7a3f1b78c6f56","2018-03-10 10:15:18","58","Child Abuse and Neglect"

                  <p>The purpose of this paper is to examine the increasing emphasis of the UK anti-money laundering (AML) legislative framework, on the financial arrangements of criminals. Our qualitative study engaged key stakeholders from the AML environment through a series of focus groups. This included law enforcement; accountants; prosecutors; bankers and, importantly, ex-offenders. We argue that the inclusion of the views of a traditionally hard to reach group of ex-offenders, adds significantly to knowledge and understanding about effectiveness of AML. The research findings suggest that, at first glance, the focus on asset recovery has been successful. However, our respondents shared with us areas of tension and inconsistencies in application of the law, in particular between police and the courts. For example, whether it was better to prosecute the predicate offence&nbsp; separately or in addition to the offence of money laundering; or whether to pursue criminal or civil recovery. We further find that criminals have been able to use their knowledge to circumvent the system, suggesting that greater effort is needed to promote cooperation, rather than competition, in successfully detecting and prosecuting offenders.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10611-018-9773-z","2018-03-11 07:15:27","112","Crime, Law and Social Change"

Over the same period, relative funding of mental health services has declined. The implication is that the latter has in some way caused the former. In this study, the behaviours of people resulting in their detention are examined, as are the motivations of the officers detaining them.Over the last 30 years, behaviours leading to detention have changed significantly. They were overwhelmingly violent, abusive, aggressive, or delusional but now they overwhelmingly relate to self-harm. Treatment rates following detention 30 years ago were over 90% but now this has fallen to around 20%. The lowest treatment rates 30 years ago were for detentions for threats of self-harm and this remains so now.There has also been the emergence of a &lsquo;risk-averse&rsquo; culture in policing, fearful of &lsquo;deaths in police contact&rsquo;, which may have significantly contributed to this increase in detentions. This has resulted in the creation of a new &lsquo;patient pathway&rsquo; which gives priority access, through the police, to otherwise difficult to access mental health services.Restricting this pathway explains how &lsquo;street triage&rsquo; schemes reduce detentions. Where the officer is advised by a Health professional not to detain a person, they are then indemnified for any subsequent outcomes. In the absence of such advice, officers feel they have no choice but to detain, where there are threats of self-harm.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay011/4930653?rss=1","2018-03-12 07:47:26","50","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"

"9934","â€œExperience of the Expected?â€ Race and Ethnicity Differences in the Effects of Police Contact on Youth","Proponents of police reform have called for changes in the way police interact with citizens, particularly with people of color. The rationale, in part, is that when people have more favorable perceptions of their police encounters, they view the police as more just and are more willing to cooperate and comply with the law. To assess whether perceptions of police-initiated encounters shape law-related outcomes, we examine how satisfaction with treatment during prior police contact affects procedural injustice, reporting intentions, norms supporting the use of violence, and delinquency. We also explore whether these relationships vary among Blacks, Whites, and Latinos. Our results indicate that youth who have been stopped or arrested fare worse than their counterparts with no police-initiated contact; however, the potentially negative ramifications of these encounters on all outcomes except violence norms are generally mitigated when youth are satisfied with their treatment. The effects of contact are mostly invariant across racial/ethnic groups when a robust set of control variables are included. We conclude that changing the perceptions of youth regarding how they are treated by the police may mitigate some of the harms of being stopped or arrested, but we caution that these perceptions are shaped by factors aside from police behavior during encounters.","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1111%2F1745-9125.12174","2018-03-12 15:30:58","94","Criminology"

                  <span>
                    <h3>Objectives</h3>
                    <p>This study evaluates the effectiveness of Minnesota Circles of Support and Accountability (MnCOSA), a sex offender reentry program implemented by the Minnesota Department of Corrections in 2008.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>Using a randomized controlled trial, this study compares recidivism and cost&ndash;benefit outcomes among sex offenders in the MnCOSA (<em>N</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;50) and control groups (<em>N</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;50).</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>The results suggest MnCOSA significantly reduced sexual recidivism, lowering the risk of rearrest for a new sex offense by 88%. In addition, MnCOSA significantly decreased all four measures of general recidivism, with reductions ranging in size from 49 to 57%. As a result of the reduction in recidivism, findings from the cost&ndash;benefit analysis reveal the program has generated an estimated $2&nbsp;million in costs avoided to the state, resulting in a benefit of $40,923 per participant. For every dollar spent on MnCOSA, the program has yielded an estimated benefit of $3.73.</p>

                  <p>This paper assesses the impact of civilian interventions in counterterrorism in Africa. The existing literature on terrorism has not sufficiently interrogated this aspect of counterterrorism within the African context. Utilizing civilian defence forces in counterterrorism appears to be widespread today unlike in the past, but most existing literature glosses over the critical contributions of civilian forces to the management of security environments, intelligence-gathering networks and combat reservoirs. This article uses stabilization theory to examine both civilian contributions and the impact of their partnerships with the military on counterterrorism. Data for this study was drawn from multiple qualitative and quantitative sources. The statistical analysis includes descriptive procedures (frequency tables and summary statistics); correlations using the Pearson coefficient and comparative analysis using the independent samples <em>t</em> test. For the purpose of comparative analysis, we categorized the study into two periods: pre-Civilian Joint Task Force (Civilian-JTF) intervention and post-Civilian-JTF involvement. We compared the consistency and intensity of Boko Haram attacks and Troop Responses (TRs) at pre-civilian and post-civilian involvements in counterterrorism. We found that the mean number of Boko Haram attacks was significantly higher before (<em>M</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;11.83, SD&nbsp;=&nbsp;4.926) than after (<em>M</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;5.35, SD&nbsp;=&nbsp;4.248) civilian intervention (<em>t</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;5.186, df&nbsp;=&nbsp;59, <em>p</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.000). The effect size for this significant difference was estimated to be large (eta squared (<em>&eta;</em><sup>2</sup>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.313). The main contributory factor was the shift in active and passive supports of the civilian population to the military, which increased the strategic and operational intelligence gathering, combat strength, and more proactive military in counterterrorism. We conclude that the civilian and military synergy should extend beyond the use of force to include a political settlement, which will address some of the grievances of Boko Haram.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1057/s41284-018-0131-8","2018-03-13 10:18:26","33","Security Journal"

                  <p>There is a dearth of research on the factors that make some jails more prone to escapes than others. Clarke and Eck&rsquo;s (Understanding risky facilities, US Department of Justice, Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, Washington, DC, <span>2007</span>) risky facilities framework posits there are seven key factors which predict a facility&rsquo;s risk to crime and disorder. Using data from 88 county jails in eight contiguous states, this study empirically tests if facility-level risk factors can account for jail escapes. Additionally, this research examines county-level characteristics to account for the macro-level explanations. Jails which had reported an escape during the study year were relatively larger, had higher populations relative to their rated capacities, and employed fewer correctional officers per inmate than their control facilities which did not report an escape. This research discusses policy implications in light of these findings.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1057/s41284-018-0132-7","2018-03-13 10:18:26","46","Security Journal"

                  <p>Community college (CC) students make up 45% of American undergraduates, but little is known about their experiences of intimate partner violence (IPV), or accompanying service use and needs. The current study used a sequential confirmatory mixed methods design among a simple random sample of female CC students (n&thinsp;=&thinsp;435), of whom 112 have experienced IPV in the past 12 months. Of these IPV survivors, 20 participated in qualitative follow-up interviews. The study assess use and perceived usefulness of college and community based resources, extent of social support, and perceived need for and barriers to service access. Campus based resources were rated as more useful than community based resources. Faculty were identified as important supports for survivors. Those experiencing IPV reported lower rates of social support compared to other students. A range of supports and services were endorsed as possibly useful by survivors. Survivors need services to address life generated risks that compound barriers to college completion created by abuse. CC survivors often balance work and parenting with education, and may benefit from different services than survivors in other educational settings.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-9958-3","2018-03-13 23:16:52","41","Journal of Family Violence"
"9950","Animal Abuse: Offender and Offence Characteristics. A Descriptive Study","This descriptive study was done to gain insight into the characteristics of animal abusers and animal abuse. On the basis of registrations by police, animal protection services, and the national reporting centre for animal welfare, 90 cases of animal abuse involving 97 offenders were analysed. Information about the offence and the offenders could be retrieved; the group of offenders was heterogeneous as to background and characteristics. Many were in debt, and 25% had 1 or more psychological disorders (e.g., antisocial personality disorders and autism spectrum disorders). Animal abuse often occurred because of frustration, and dogs were the main victims. Most cases of abuse took place in the home of the abuser. By taking the offence of animal abuse as starting point for studying the offenders' characteristics, we gained insight into a broad spectrum of characteristics and backgrounds than would have been found if we had started from a domestic violence perspective or the graduation hypothesis. A larger study is needed to verify findings.","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fjip.1499","2018-03-14 09:02:03","73","Journal of Investigative Psychology and Offender Profiling"

In this study, we investigated the differential impacts of five types of maltreatment exposure (physical maltreatment, sexual maltreatment, neglect, other type, and multiple types) on the associations between four types of organized activities (mentored groups, art and music clubs, sport clubs, and academic clubs) and academic and socioemotional development (school engagement, delinquency, depressive symptoms, and trauma symptoms) of adolescents who were investigated by Child Protective Services (CPS) for maltreatment exposure. Data came from a national, longitudinal sample of 790 adolescents in contact with CPS in the U.S. After controlling for demographic characteristics of participants and prior levels of each outcome, multiple linear regression models were fitted to the data with interactions between the organized activities and the maltreatment types. The main findings of this study included: 1) adolescents who participated in mentored groups, sport clubs, and academic clubs reported higher levels of school engagement; 2) adolescents who participated in academic clubs reported fewer depressive symptoms; 3) adolescents who participated in art and music clubs reported more trauma symptoms compared to non-participants; and 4) the effects of participation in mentored groups on delinquency and trauma symptoms differed by maltreatment type.

Socioeconomic status of mothers, family economic pressure, and mothers&rsquo; exposure to stress were measured. Special attention was given to the perceived availability of social support as one of protective factors potentially buffering the negative impact of risks of child abuse. The community sample included 746 mothers (Mage&#8239;=&#8239;42.85; SDage&#8239;=&#8239;5.319). The results showed that the risk of child abuse is higher for mothers with lower education, those who perceive themselves as suffering greater family economic hardship, those who have experienced a higher number of stressful events, and those with lower social support. When the mothers perceive a lower availability of social support, the effects of exposure to cumulative risk, namely the combination of socioeconomic status, economic pressure, and exposure to stress, are stronger. Since social support proved to be one of the key protective factors in the relationship between adverse life circumstances and parenting, the development of effective and non-stigmatized interventions aiming to increase social support, positive social relationships, and adequate parenting practices for parents facing economic hardship is an important direction for future family policy measures.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213418300188%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D0e12177315fb6112fb6ce0d633ad4423","2018-03-14 10:30:18","33","Child Abuse and Neglect"

Little is known about the specific circumstances under which supportive relationships may help disrupt this cycle of violence throughout the life course. We conducted two complementary analyses to assess whether maternal social support in early childhood, and also paternal involvement in middle childhood, could prevent the intergenerational transmission of violence, using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (n<hsp sp=""0.25""></hsp>=<hsp sp=""0.25""></hsp>11,384). We found that higher levels of maternal social support in the postpartum period reduced the odds of offspring maltreatment at ages 0&ndash;8 years (OR<hsp sp=""0.25""></hsp>=<hsp sp=""0.25""></hsp>0.95, 95% CI 0.93&ndash;0.96). When classifying mothers according to their abuse history, this protective association of social support was observed among mothers with no history of childhood maltreatment and among those with only childhood maltreatment (and not postpartum intimate partner violence [IPV]), but not among mothers who reported IPV since the child&rsquo;s birth. We then extended our analysis of these offspring forward in time and found that paternal involvement at ages 9&ndash;10 years was associated with a reduced risk of offspring self-reported violent perpetration at ages 18&ndash;20 years (OR<hsp sp=""0.25""></hsp>=<hsp sp=""0.25""></hsp>0.85, 95% CI<hsp sp=""0.25""></hsp>=<hsp sp=""0.25""></hsp>0.77&ndash;0.94). This protective association was generally apparent among all subgroups of children, including those with a history of childhood maltreatment. Together these results highlight the protective influence of supportive relationships against the intergenerational transmission of violence, depending on abuse history, context, and timing, with important implications for the prevention of childhood maltreatment and mitigation of its negative effects.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213417303599%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D4496dd01f1ffdf61f11a0afee93136b0","2018-03-14 10:30:18","33","Child Abuse and Neglect"

Adolescents&rsquo; exposure to violence at home, in school and in their communities can lead to detrimental outcomes in education. In particular, adolescents who are more frequently exposed to multiple forms of violence are at risk of school delay. This paper investigates the potential for supportive parenting to protect against adolescents&rsquo; school delay in this context. With this aim, this paper applies structural equation modelling to a sample of 503 adolescents exposed to multiple forms of violence from 40 socioeconomically disadvantaged communities. Adolescents&rsquo; self-report data on child abuse in the family, school and community, and adolescents&rsquo; perceptions of positive parenting, consistent discipline, good monitoring, parental involvement and social support were analyzed. Results showed that perceptions of more positive parenting and consistent discipline moderated the relationship between more frequent exposure to multiple forms of violence and school delay.

In this study, we surveyed neighborhood associations in Kyoto to test a theoretical model for social capital and community based crime prevention that we developed as part of our earlier work in Kobe. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) based on survey data and police records for street crimes and residential burglary suggest that specific efforts by community residents can enrich social capital and lead to community safety and security both subjectively and objectively. Social capital had a significant effect on the reduction of street crime, although not for burglary, and our findings suggest that social capital reduces the fear of crime and increases a sense well-being for families and seniors. Although these well-being measures are subjective, emotional change is important in a context where there is no association between actual crime rates and fear of crime.

Using a sample of 392 Korean banking employees, a series of structural equation models were estimated. The results showed that the perception of increased investment in anti-occupational fraud enhanced two mediating variables, ethical culture and monitoring control. However, only the perception of an improved ethical culture was negatively related to the perceived frequency of occupational fraud with statistical significance. These findings imply that investing in ethical culture is more effective in preventing occupational fraud.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS1756061617302690%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D381449a1450be52e0c301e3c44535800","2018-03-14 12:32:04","27","International Journal of Law, Crime and Justice"

Two types of legitimacy may be recognized - primary and secondary. Primary legitimacy derives its validity from its coherence with ethical principles of responsibility, thus together shaping a message about what is right and wrong. Under this interpretation, severing of the ties between law and ethics does not mean that criminal law ceases to bind in the formalistic sense. Clearly, however, in such a case it loses one of the fundamental rationales for its validity, and it becomes increasingly more difficult to enforce it. Secondary legitimacy, contemporarily often considered the only one, reposes the validity of criminal law in decisions of an authorized legislator, thus deciding upon the bindingness of normative determinations (however, other constructs may also perform this function). Justifiability of ethical legitimacy of criminal law, where the principle of dignity of the person is dominant, is shown by reference to the example of unconscious non-intentionality. Of course, ethical legitimacy of criminal law and the choice of a constitutional anthropological vision have implications not only for this institution. Others include the theory of a criminal act, attempt, assignment of liability for a consequence, defences and errors.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS175606161730277X%26_version%3D1%26md5%3De8c7bdabc07b985c891271edda7209b3","2018-03-14 12:32:04","33","International Journal of Law, Crime and Justice"

                  <p>Within the criminal justice system, confessions are an extremely powerful form of evidence. Unfortunately, innocent people sometimes falsely confess to crimes they did not actually commit. Such travesties of justice have sparked a significant degree of academic research into the false confession phenomenon. Within the existing literature, there exists a conceptual framework that the interrogative methods and actions of law enforcement officers are a key cause of false confessions with some researchers going so far as to suggest that law enforcement interrogators act as confidence men who trick criminal subjects into confessing. However, few researchers have actually questioned law enforcement officers about false confessions and even fewer have consulted with officers who specialize in interrogation. This study is a subset of a larger qualitative case study designed to explore the experiences of 13 federal law enforcement polygraph examiners who specialize in interrogation regarding their approach to criminal interrogation and their experiences with both true and false confessions. This study focused on the personal processes federal law enforcement polygraph examiners use in reviewing Miranda rights and documenting confessions. NVivo software was used to organize the data. Common themes in interview responses were then identified and revealed that participants employ an open, detailed, and straightforward approach in reviewing Miranda rights and documenting the confessions of criminal subjects. These findings contradict the premise that law enforcement interrogators inherently operate as confidence men by tricking and manipulating criminal subjects.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9263-3","2018-03-14 13:17:38","70","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"

                  <p>Successful drug intervention policies rely on timely assessment of size of drug users and close monitoring of trend regarding drug abuse. Taking advantage of data collected by the Central Registration System for Drug Abusers of Macau (CRSDAM), this study applied open population capture-recapture models with data augmentation techniques to estimate the size of drug users and to identify influential factors on capture and survival probabilities from 2009 to 2014. In particular, the data augmentation technique was used to address missing data issues. The estimated size of drug users has been slowly declining from 2442 (95% Bayesian credible interval [BCI] 2042&ndash;2914) in 2009 to 807 (95% BCI 654&ndash;1000) in 2014 with a small fluctuation of 2251 (95% BIC 1950&ndash;2599) in 2011, and the estimated cumulative size of drug users is 6199 (95% BCI 5651&ndash;6873), which is correspondent to a prevalence rate of 1.20% of the current population aged 15 to 54. Although the estimated sizes of total, narcotic, and other drug users were declining, the size of stimulant users might be increasing. People who used narcotics as their first drug and who were reported by governmental agencies were more likely to stay in the registration system, while those who used needle injection were less likely to stay. Governmental agencies, higher education, and using needle injection were negatively associated with the probability of capture over time, while using narcotics as the first drug was positively associated with it.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11417-018-9266-0","2018-03-14 23:15:11","27","Asian Journal of Criminology"

The aims of this study were to report the prevalence serial-homicide offences and the characteristics of serial-homicide offenders in a non-North American context. The study included all convicted serial-homicide offenders in Sweden from 1973 to 2012 (nÂ =Â 25), as well as a population-based control sample of single-homicide offenders collected during 2007 and 2009 (nÂ =Â 201). Similar to U.S. findings, approximately 1.6% of homicides could be attributed to serial-homicide offenders. Serial offenders were more often diagnosed with personality disorders and autism-spectrum disorders compared with single offenders; and serial offences more often involved victims who were female and unacquainted with the offender, as well as planning, sexual motives, and asphyxia as method of violence. One third of serial offences involved actions aimed at disguising the manner of death; such actions were considerably less common in single-homicide offences. Few offenders displayed the traditional profile of a serial-homicide offender; however, one third displayed sexual motives, a rate roughly 10 times higher than that in the single-homicide group. The study concludes that serial-homicide offenders should be subjected to forensic-psychiatric examinations and that research involving cross-contextual differences and similarities in serial-homicide offenders is needed.","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fjip.1500","2018-03-15 08:31:59","46","Journal of Investigative Psychology and Offender Profiling"

The movement of and trade in aspirant young (male) footballers from West Africa to Europe, and more recently to Asia, dominates these accounts. The paper aims to discuss these issues.   Design/methodology/approach This paper provides an overview of scholarship on this topic, with a specific focus on exploring how this form of human trafficking intersects with the broader debates over childrenâ€™s rights in the context of exploitation tied to the irregular forms of migration.   Findings The paper illustrates how popular narratives associated with the trafficking of young West African footballers mimic stereotypical portrayals of child trafficking, which have implications for the solutions put forward. It is argued that popular representations of football-related child trafficking are problematic for several reasons, but two are emphasised here. First, they perpetuate a perception that the mobility of young African footballers entails a deviant form of agency in need of fixing, while simultaneously disassociating the desire to migrate from the broader social structures that need to be addressed. Second, and relatedly, they result in regulations and policy solutions that are inadvertently reductive and often at odds with the best interests of the children they seek to protect.   Originality/value This an original study of the narratives associated with the trafficking of young West African footballers and those of child trafficking.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JCRPP-01-2018-0005?af=R","2018-03-15 10:31:34","70","Journal of Criminological Research, Policy and Practice"

Design/methodology/approach This paper comprises desk-based research of secondary sources. The lack of official data on the harms experienced by professional wrestlers means that much of the data regarding this is derived from quantitative and qualitative accounts from internet sites dedicated to this issue.   Findings A major finding is that with regard to the work-related harms experienced by professional wrestlers, the business may not be wholly to be blamed, but nor is it entirely blame free. It proposes that one way the work-related harms can be understood is via an examination of the political economic context of neo-liberalism from the 1980s onwards and subsequent state-corporate actions and inactions.   Practical implications The paper raises questions about the regulation of the professional wrestling industry together with the misclassification of wrestlersâ€™ worker status (also known as wage theft and tax fraud) and the potential role they play in the harms incurred in this industry.   Social implications The potential wider social implications of the misclassification of workers are raised.   Originality/value The originality and value of this paper is the examination of work-related harms within the professional wrestling industry through the lens of state-corporate crime.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JCRPP-01-2018-0004?af=R","2018-03-15 10:31:34","74","Journal of Criminological Research, Policy and Practice"

The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, it critically reviews how match-fixing is typified as a policy problem. Second, it advances an analysis of the legal framework and regulatory system for sports betting as a causal source for â€œroutinizedâ€ match-fixing.   Design/methodology/approach This study extracts and synthesises (cross-national) materials from policies, media releases and scholarly works on the subject of match-fixing and sports betting. The analysis is framed by the contrasts between rational choice and sociological institutionalist approaches.   Findings Match-fixing is typically attributed to: criminal organisations and illegal sports betting; vulnerable individuals; and failure of governance on the part of sports organisations. Each cause holds assumptions of utility-maximising actors and it is argued that due consideration be given to the fundamental risks inherent in legal sports betting regimes.   Research limitations/implications Match-fixing in sport is a recurrent social problem, transcending national boundaries and involving a wide range of actors and, sporting disciplines and levels of competition. Within such an environment, it may matter little how strong the incentive structures and education programmes are, when betting on human beings is both normatively and cognitively advanced as a value and institutionally permitted as a practice.   Originality/value This paper argues that legal betting regimes paradoxically contribute to routinised match-fixing because: for betting customers there is no qualitative, ethical difference between legal and illegal operators; and legalisation serves to normalise and legitimate the view of athletes as objects for betting (like cards or dice).","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JCRPP-01-2018-0006?af=R","2018-03-15 10:31:34","66","Journal of Criminological Research, Policy and Practice"

Next, the relevant laws and adjudication of sexual violence operant in American colleges are outlined. Finally, college athletics is placed into this bigger context by highlighting a number of particular cases to illustrate a broader understanding of collegiate athletes involved in sexual violence.   Design/methodology/approach The author examines the history of rape laws and adjudication and the federal laws relevant to institutions of higher education. The author investigates the debate over adjudication of sexual violence within the criminal justice system or through campus systems. The author read previous literature to determine links between sexual violence and collegiate athletes and highlights particular cases that have gotten significant media attention for clues to the rape prone culture that can be fostered within collegiate athletics.   Findings This analysis highlights how collegiate athletics can be a context that creates a rape prone culture and that universities and the criminal justice system need further reform to overcome long-standing beliefs in rape myths which perpetuate sexual violence, discourage reporting by victims of sexual violence, deter bystander intervention and underplay the impact of sexual violence on victims. Thus, structural changes are needed within collegiate athletic cultures as well as on college campuses to address sexual violence.   Practical implications College campuses and athletic departments must address climates that create rape prone cultures. There remains a need for systematic data collection of perpetrators of sexual violence, along side data collection of experiences of sexual violence. College campuses and athletic departments must have in place procedures and policy that adhere to federal law, whereby athletes are not treated differently from non-athletes and victims are offered appropriate services that recognize the trauma of sexual violence. Further progress toward a standard of affirmative consent is needed to move toward greater sexual autonomy for everyone.   Originality/value There is evidence that collegiate athletes are disproportionately represented among the population of sexual violence perpetrators on college campuses. Thus, it is vital to understand this population and that connection. The value of this work is to explicate the complicated adjudication process between university disciplinary processes and the criminal justice system.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JCRPP-07-2017-0023?af=R","2018-03-15 10:31:34","40","Journal of Criminological Research, Policy and Practice"

Design/methodology/approach A historical approach informed by recent criminological adaptations of genealogy was utilized, using primary and secondary sources.   Findings Three time periods involving distinct frameworks for combating doping were identified, each with their own advantages and limitations: pre-1967, post-1967 up until the creation of the World Anti-Doping Agency in 1999, and post-1999.   Originality/value This study contextualizes the recent legalistic turn toward combating doping in sport, bringing greater understanding to the limitations of present anti-doping practices.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JCRPP-01-2018-0003?af=R","2018-03-15 10:31:34","38","Journal of Criminological Research, Policy and Practice"

The purpose of this paper is to critically examine the history and functions of CAS, with a particular focus on the ways in which athletesâ€™ rights are threatened by the IOCâ€™s Code of Sports-Related Arbitration.   Design/methodology/approach The author reviews relevant law literature and media sources.   Findings The concept of lex sportiva (global sport law), general arbitration practices and controversies concerning CASâ€™s impartiality are investigated, and the â€œstrict liabilityâ€ principle that CAS applies to doping allegations is assessed. This analysis points to a long record of inconsistencies and contradictions in the history and function of CAS. The findings lead to questions of arbitration or litigation; confidential or public proceedings; specialist or generalist arbitrators; lex sportiva or international legal principles; precedential or non-precedential awards; and civil or criminal burden of proof.   Originality/value These unresolved issues demonstrate how the IOC struggles to maintain supremacy over world sport by promoting sport exceptionalism, and provide possible grounds for athletesâ€™ future challenges to CAS.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JCRPP-01-2018-0002?af=R","2018-03-15 10:31:34","64","Journal of Criminological Research, Policy and Practice"

It is thus unclear whether entrapment is also prevalent in right-wing terrorism cases. This article employs a mixed-method approach to analyze entrapment claims in right-wing terrorism cases. Quantitative analyses of a database of post-9/11 terrorism prosecutions show that right-wing cases have significantly fewer entrapment indicators than neojihadi and left-wing terrorism cases, and are far less likely to have particularly high entrapment scores. Detailed qualitative analyses of five right-wing terrorism investigations reveal that four cases feature potentially strong entrapment claims. However, a comparative analysis finds that these claims are significantly weaker than those in many neojihadi and left-wing cases. We theorize that micro-, meso- and macro-level mechanisms enabled the occasional emergence, but far lower prevalence and strength, of viable entrapment claims in right-wing terrorism investigations.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS1756061617301994%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D24acdd1d921993a71039cb2b54172317","2018-03-15 12:31:21","53","International Journal of Law, Crime and Justice"

The article finally addresses the impact of volunteering activities on the neighborhoods in which they are undertaken, as well as implications of article findings for discussions on neighborhood watch programs in non-Japanese contexts.

Volunteers phrased their motivation in terms of both such town building idea(l)s and the threat of crime. They represented crime as existing outside of the neighborhood, and as both effectively impacted by volunteering activities and immutably threatening. While the impact of volunteering activities on crime rates is difficult to assess, these activities in any case provide opportunities for increased social interaction and physical activity, while also resulting in spaces in which the neighborhood's eyes are always watching.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS1756061618300727%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Dfaa76c323b88fe3a4bf2fa64e3bba2cd","2018-03-15 12:31:21","34","International Journal of Law, Crime and Justice"

However, nonviolent crowds also pose equal challenges for the police. Major sporting events, musical festivals, religious and political celebrations attract large crowds that need sensitive policing. Nevertheless, policing tactics for the two situations are generally similar. Research on public order policing has relevance and lessons for policing of large non-violent crowds too. This paper presents a case study of police management of Ujjain Kumbh Mela, which attracts millions at one place for a religious ritual. We analyze characteristics of the crowd and strategies adopted by the police based upon extensive field data of the recent event of 2016. This study suggests that the Indian police, unaware of the research on public order policing followed many of the lessons reported in public order policing in western societies. We contend that experience and practice counts, but by institutionalizing research as part of its organization the Indian police could enhance it capabilities to handle serious challenges that confront it on a daily basis. Lessons for handling non-violent crowds in democratic societies are also drawn.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay012/4939261?rss=1","2018-03-16 07:47:19","52","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"

An understanding of emergency crowds is therefore crucial in ensuring that incidents are managed as effectively as possible. The elaborated social identity model of crowd behaviour emphasizes that the way in which emergency responders manage crowds during an incident can play a crucial role in determining how members of the public react. Specifically, if affected casualties see emergency responders&rsquo; instructions and actions as legitimate, this will result in increased identification and cooperation between emergency responders and members of the public. In this paper, we show how the social identity approach can be applied to best explain crowd behaviour during mass emergencies and disasters, and how this improved theoretical understanding can be used to generate specific recommendations for operational good practice during incident management.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay013/4939262?rss=1","2018-03-16 07:47:19","52","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"

Despite the establishment of a Council for Offender Rehabilitation Reform in 2006 and consequent legislative clarification of the roles of professional probation officers (PPOs) and volunteer probation officers (VPOs), the repeat offender rate has been increasing and the prevention of recidivism remains an urgent issue in criminal justice in Japan. At the same time, it is important to recognize that parole and probation revocation rates have dropped slightly and that recidivism rates are lower for sexual offenders who have undergone specialized treatment programmes administered by PPOs. This article considers what issues were addressed by Offender Rehabilitation Reform and examine whether further clarification of the roles of VPOs and PPOs is needed in terms of legislative status, caseload, personnel matters, and functions in the community. Finally, this article will discuss ideal roles for VPOs and PPOs in the face of changing social contexts in Japan.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS1756061618300715%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D2be1b6033b02aff5aa313b7ab2c3e6b7","2018-03-16 12:31:02","40","International Journal of Law, Crime and Justice"
"10002","Officer Appearance and Perceptions of Police: Accoutrements As Signals of Intent","<span><div>Abstract</div>The present research experimentally evaluates the effects of vests, gloves, batons, sunglasses, and hats on perceptions of police officers as aggressive, approachable, friendly, respectful, and accountable. The results reveal a plethora of findings, which together suggest that variation in officer appearance elicits variation in perceptions of officers. For example, high-visibility vests exhibit positive effects on perceptions of officers. Black gloves, longstick batons, and sunglasses, in contrast, exhibit negative effects on perceptions of officers. Load-bearing vests exhibit mixed effects and baseball hats exhibit no significant effects. Accoutrements as signals of intent are important means by which police exude presence and nonverbally communicate their philosophies and intentions to the public. Practitioners and academics alike should consider these perceptual effects when examining the police-perception nexus. By strategically equipping and deploying officers in appropriate aesthetics, police departments may enhance their relations with the public.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay015/4939537?rss=1","2018-03-16 12:46:54","106","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"

A history of CSA can impact the childbearing experience of mothers and fathers; affecting their mental health, parenting skills and compromising infant development. Nonetheless, the perinatal period offers huge opportunity for intervention and hope. This literature review collates evidence for perinatal psychosocial interventions targeting both mothers and fathers who are survivors of CSA. Publications dating from 1970 to June 2016 were searched using Medline, Maternity and Infant Health, PsychINFO, PsychArticles, PubMed and the International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS). There were no perinatal interventions that considered the needs of survivor fathers. Sixteen publications on 9 psychosocial perinatal interventions for CSA survivors were identified. However, no sub-analyses specific to CSA survivors were reported. Trauma-specific perinatal interventions drew from a range of theoretical models and varied widely in format. Generally interventions were associated with improvements in maternal mental health, parenting competence, infant attachment security and positive public health outcomes. They were safe and feasible to implement, acceptable to parents and therapist, and therapists were able to implement protocols with adequate fidelity. Yet current data is hampered by small sample size, inconsistent reporting of CSA rates and outcome measures, scarcity of observational data and longer-term follow-up. Intervention modifications are proposed for CSA survivors in view of their unique childbearing experiences.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213418301224%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Dfbaf60b8382bb2aca67b825b508da51e","2018-03-19 11:00:19","46","Child Abuse and Neglect"

Yet, whether these variables influence the believability of CSA disclosure and subsequent clinical decisions made by practicing psychologists is underexplored. A vignette of trauma disclosure from a hypothetical adult client was presented via an online survey to 292 registered psychologists. Participants rated the believability of the disclosure, answered an open-ended item regarding treatment planning, and completed the Brief Betrayal Trauma Survey to measure personal trauma history. Results indicated that female psychologists believed disclosures significantly more than male psychologists and that disclosures comprised of continuous memories were believed more than recently recovered memories. A significant interaction between gender and personal trauma history was also revealed. Female psychologists believed disclosures regardless of their personal trauma history, while male psychologists with a personal history of trauma believed disclosures significantly more than male psychologists without personal trauma history. Reported believability of the disclosure, while unrelated to treatment planning, was associated with a reported intention to validate the client&rsquo;s experience. The results support that, similar to community samples, gender and a personal trauma history impact psychologist believability of CSA disclosure. The research further supports that psychologist level of belief then translates into clinical implications.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213418301182%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Dcb950133868ccc47d995d0f804943e25","2018-03-19 11:00:19","36","Child Abuse and Neglect"

Childhood adversities, such as abuse, neglect, and related household stressors, are common, interrelated and contribute to multiple adverse social, behavioral and health outcomes throughout the lifespan. The present article provides further discussion regarding adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) screening in healthcare utilizing the etic and emic perspectives. Screening in the healthcare system leans toward the etic view: objective observations of symptoms, which may then lead to intervention delivery. Whereas the emic view provides the subjective perspective as experienced by participants of a system, culture, or common group. Finkelhor&rsquo;s argument about cautions regarding widespread screening is relevant in the current allopathic healthcare system, which utilizes an etic perspective and where evidence-based ACEs interventions within a biomedical-centric model are lacking. Therefore, in healthcare settings, universal ACEs screening may serve the clinicians with a surveillance tool to inform and guide medical practice and policy as they relate to delivering trauma-informed care. The Public Health Code of Ethics and Basis for Action reminds us about the values approach for collecting and using data ethically to protect population health.

                  <p>The police service in England and Wales has developed a new approach to police leadership where individuals from outside of the police service can now enter directly to leadership ranks. Previous research identified that officers place great value on being led by someone who has experience of being a police officer. Adopting a social identity perspective, the current paper reports on quantitative and qualitative data about police officer views on direct entry and existing police leadership captured as part of a wider national survey (<em>N</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;12,549) of police officers in England and Wales. The paper identifies the importance that shared identity and credibility play in police follower/leadership relationships. It argues that direct-entry police leaders face credibility issues linked to their lack of shared police identity but also that serving officers perceive existing leaders to be poor because they believe they have forgotten what it is like to be a police officer. This paper develops a new theoretical and empirical approach to police leadership utilizing social and organizational psychology theory and research. The paper suggests that if police leaders understand police identity, then they can create propitious conditions within which police officers will follow their leaders.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9264-2","2018-03-19 13:17:05","103","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"

Design/methodology/approach The current study uses a narrative meta-review of racial disparities in police use of force through a systematic and exhaustive search of several academic databases (e.g. Criminal Justice Abstracts; EBSCO Host, PsychInfo, etc.).   Findings The current meta-review identified 41 studies that matched the selection criteria. These studies examined public and police officer perceptions of use of force, rates of use of force, types of force used, neighborhood contextual correlates of use of force, and severity of force used. The relationship between race and use of force remains unclear after an examination of these studies. This indicates a need for high-quality research focusing on comparable operationalization of variables and stronger methodologies.   Research limitations/implications The research implications derived from this meta-review indicate a need for increased research to better understand the intersections of race and police use of force (and the factors that increase the likelihood of force being used more broadly).   Practical implications The practical implications derived from this meta-review indicate the need for monitoring techniques, such as the use of police body-worn cameras that could serve to deter inappropriate use of force.   Originality/value The state-of-the-art review on racial disparities in police use of force is the first of its kind. This study comprehensively reviews the literature on racial disparities in police use of force. This study will be useful for those who wish to further explore racial disparities and use of force issues in policing, and for police managers and administrators who want to address concerns related to racial disparities in use of force in their organization.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-09-2017-0112?af=R","2018-03-20 10:32:19","88","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

Computer vision is a possible solution. An ongoing research project on the application of computer vision within a municipal police department is described. The paper aims to discuss these issues.   Design/methodology/approach Following the demystification of computer vision technology, its potential for police agencies is developed within a focus on computer vision as a solution for two common surveillance camera tasks (live monitoring of multiple surveillance cameras and summarizing archived video files). Three unaddressed research questions (can specialized computer vision applications for law enforcement be developed at this time, how will computer vision be utilized within existing public safety camera monitoring rooms, and what are the system-wide impacts of a computer vision capability on local criminal justice systems) are considered.   Findings Despite computer vision becoming accessible to law enforcement agencies the impact of computer vision has not been discussed or adequately researched. There is little knowledge of computer vision or its potential in the field.   Originality/value This paper introduces and discusses computer vision from a law enforcement perspective and will be valuable to police personnel tasked with monitoring large camera networks and considering computer vision as a system upgrade.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-11-2016-0158?af=R","2018-03-20 10:32:19","69","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

Design/methodology/approach Key findings from a national survey of police agencies on use of force policy and from an in-depth look at police use of force outcomes across eight cities published over the last ten years are synthesized to provide a cumulative perspective regarding the outcomes of the project.   Findings The majority of police departments had a written force policy and reporting requirements, however, there was no commonly accepted force policy. Patrol officers were conservative in their views of what is reasonable force, administrative policy does matter in influencing force usage, and the use of a TASER impacted the likelihood of injury for both officers and citizens. Additional findings were also reviewed in the areas of complaints, police culture, first-line supervision, college education, and promotional aspirations.   Originality/value While federal funding for policing related research projects are commonplace, taking a look back ten years later and summarizing key findings is uncommon. Doing so provides concise feedback to practitioners in one readily digestible manuscript. Furthermore, the paper also demonstrates the additional value to the original investment made by the National Institute of Justice.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-04-2017-0047?af=R","2018-03-20 10:32:19","90","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

These findings would then be compared with the results of a national survey of hostage (crisis) negotiators in the hopes of finding information that might be helpful with team dynamics, officer selection for these teams, and with operational dynamics and successful resolution of SWAT callouts.   Design/methodology/approach Active SWAT officers (n=277) from various law enforcement entities in 21 states participated in this survey research. They completed a demographic questionnaire, questions about their callout experiences and experiences on their SWAT team, the Big 5 Personality Inventory, the Cognitive-Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, and the General Decision-Making Style questionnaire. These results were then compared with the same results obtained from a national survey of hostage (crisis) negotiators (n=514) and patrol officers (n=72).   Findings Common personality and decision-making styles emerged from the SWAT survey, and correlations between these variables and the successful resolution of SWAT callouts are discussed. These results were then compared with negotiators and patrol officers via an ANOVA. Distinct differences between these groups emerged.   Research limitations/implications Recruiting research participants from law enforcement, much less from a closed group such as SWAT operators, is difficult. The response rate for this study was low, and was due in part to the agency themselves declining to participate. The current study relied on honest self-report, which is always a limitation of this type of survey research. Another limitation was that lack of statistically significant findings for the multivariate and the binomial logistic regression analysis. No extrapolation of the relationship between personality, cognitive-emotion regulation, and decision-making styles and the outcome and resolution of callouts is possible based on these findings.   Practical implications This research could have direct effect on the training and selection of SWAT team officers and hostage negotiators. There is also information provided that may impact the operation and coordination of these groups as they work together during callouts in the community.   Social implications The current social climate in the USA seems to be calling for police departments to do everything possible to resolve high risk and dangerous situations with as much care and as little force as possible. In order to achieve successful and peaceful resolution of these SWAT callout situations, departments must deploy officers with the necessary skills, personality, and decision-making abilities.   Originality/value There is very little general research on SWAT teams, and almost nothing on SWAT operator experience, personality, or decision making. These findings have value and application in SWAT operator selection and training, along with SWAT and negotiator dynamics and decision making when trying to successfully and peacefully resolve a SWAT callout operation.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-10-2016-0156?af=R","2018-03-20 10:32:19","37","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"
"10039","How Police Officers Perform in Encounters With the Public","Policing: An International Journal, Volume 41, Issue 2, Page 215-232, April 2018. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose The purpose of this paper is to develop and describe the implementation of a novel method for creating interval-level metrics for objectively assessing police officer behaviors during an encounter with the public. These behaviors constitute officer performance and affect the probability of desirable encounter outcomes. The metrics measure concrete, micro-level performance in the common types of complex, dynamic, and low-information police-public encounters that often require immediate action using â€œnaturalisticâ€ decision making. Difficulty metrics also were developed to control for situational variability. The utility of measuring what officers do vs probabilistic outcomes is explored with regard to informing policymaking, field practice, and training.   Design/methodology/approach Metric sets were developed separately for three types of police-public encounters: deadly force judgment and decision making, cross-cultural tactical social interaction, and crisis intervention. In each, â€œreverse concept mappingâ€ was used with a different diverse focus group of â€œtrue expertsâ€ to authoritatively deconstruct implicit concepts and derive important variables. Variables then were scaled with Thurstoneâ€™s method using 198 diverse expert trainers to create interval-level metrics for performance and situational difficulty. Metric utility was explored during two experimental laboratory studies and in response to a problematic police encounter.   Findings Objective, interval-level metric sets were developed for measuring micro-level police performance and encounter difficulty. Validation and further refinement are required.   Research limitations/implications This novel method provides a practical way to rapidly develop metrics that measure micro-level performance during police-public encounters much more precisely than was previously possible.   Originality/value The metrics developed provide a foundation for measuring officersâ€™ performance as they exercise discretion, engage people, and affect perceptions of police legitimacy.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-11-2016-0166?af=R","2018-03-20 10:32:19","153","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

Specifically, a series of items first inquired about negative attitudes attributable to deadly force incidents throughout the country, followed by items tapping into theoretically relevant concepts including self-legitimacy, audience legitimacy, and peer attachment.   Findings Findings suggest that like line-level officers, police managers may also harbor various attitudes attributable to a Ferguson effect â€“ including less willingness to be proactive, reduced motivation, less job enjoyment, and a belief that crime will ultimately rise as officers â€œde-police.â€ However, officers who believe their communities afford legitimacy to the police were less likely to report these sentiments. Study limitations and avenues for future research are also discussed.   Originality/value This is the first study to consider how police managers have been impacted by highly publicized deadly force incidents in recent years. It underscores the importance of maintaining legitimacy in the public eye, particularly in the post-Ferguson era of American policing.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-11-2016-0164?af=R","2018-03-20 10:32:19","68","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"
"10041","The Consequences of Restricting Police Arrest Authority: Less Deterrence and More Crime","Policing: An International Journal, Volume 41, Issue 2, Page 233-246, April 2018. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose Past research indicates that increasing police arrests deters crime. However, little research exists on how restricting police arrests affects crime. The purpose of this paper is to test whether restrictions on police authority to arrest affects deterrence and crime rates.   Design/methodology/approach The data consisted of crime statistics for 105 criminal suspects from a medium-sized police department in the western USA. A 2Ã—4 mixed analysis of variance compared the suspectsâ€™ criminal activity for a four-month period before and after the arrest restrictions were imposed to ascertain how they affected deterrence and crime rates.   Findings The restrictions on police arrests significantly increased the crime rate. Moreover, the crime rate increased the longer the restrictions on police arrest authority were in effect. In sum, the present study provides empirical support for the hypothesis that restrictions on police arrest authority decrease deterrence and increase the crime rate.   Practical implications The present study suggests that restrictions on police arrest authority decreases deterrence and may significantly increase the crime rate. The restrictions may also have deleterious effects on police departments. Several states have recently imposed restrictions on police authority to arrest, and many other states are considering implementing such restrictions. Policy makers should carefully consider the results of the present study before implementing these policies.   Originality/value The study fills a void in the crime literature by demonstrating that restrictions on police authority to arrest can decrease deterrence and increase the crime rate.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-11-2016-0165?af=R","2018-03-20 10:32:19","66","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

In 2014, over 48,000 law enforcement officers assaulted while on duty. Although over one in four of these resulted in injury, little is known about the conditions under which injury is likely to occur. The purpose of this paper is to provide an assessment of the individual and situational factors that predict injurious assaults against law enforcement.   Design/methodology/approach Using logistic regression, the current study analyzes data from the 2012 National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) on all assaults against the police (n=8,987) in order to understand, within a routine activities theoretical framework, how individual-level characteristics (i.e. officer and offender characteristics) and situational influences (i.e. assignment type, activity type, and location) predict the likelihood that an assault will result in injury.   Findings Overall, findings suggest support for a routine activities theory of violence against the police. Initiating an arrest, one-officer vehicle type, and incidents occurring on highways/roads were all more likely to result in injurious assaults against the police. Other predictors of injury include officer and offender demographics as well as the time the incident took place.   Research limitations/implications This research was unable to control for some factors that may influence the likelihood of injury such as wearing body armor. Additionally, NIBRS data are not nationally representative, which limits the generalizability of the findings.   Originality/value This is one of the first papers to use national data to examine the individual and situational factors that predict injurious assaults against law enforcement.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-09-2016-0144?af=R","2018-03-20 10:32:19","98","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

Design/methodology/approach Data for the study were obtained from a random-stratified sampling telephone survey of 1,806 residents in metropolitan Taipei, which is located in the Northern part of Taiwan Island, during May of 2014. Given the fact that these residents were nested in 41 districts in metropolitan Taipei, hierarchical linear modeling was employed to examine the effects of both individual and district-level factors on satisfaction with police services simultaneously.   Findings Results indicate that, among neighborhood context variables, mean levels of victimization, fear of crime, and perceived disorder erode citizen satisfaction with police. In contrast, collective efficacy produces a positive effect on the perception of police performance after controlling for demographics. With respect to those district-level variables, citizen/police ratio, the total crime rate/100,000 habitants, and the average of household income significantly impact public assessment of police services.   Originality/value Only limited empirical research has examined neighborhood context effects on residentsâ€™ satisfaction with policing services, and virtually no such research has been carried out by examining individual and contextual-level factors at play simultaneously in Taiwan. This research fills this gap.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-11-2016-0160?af=R","2018-03-20 10:32:19","43","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

No research to date has attempted to predict running away in CSEC victims. The present study aimed to 1) characterize a clinically referred sample of girls who were victims of CSEC and compare them to other high-risk girls (i.e., girls who also have a history of trauma and running away, but deny CSEC); and 2) examine the utility of using the Youth Level of Service/Case Management Inventory (YLS/CMI) to predict future running away. Data were collected from de-identified charts of 80 girls (mean age&#8239;=&#8239;15.38, SD&#8239;=&#8239;1.3, 37.9% White, 52.5% CSEC victims) who were referred for psychological assessment by the Department of Child Services. Girls in the CSEC group were more likely to have experienced sexual abuse (&chi;<sup loc=""post"">2</sup>&#8239;=&#8239;6.85, p&#8239;=&#8239;.009), an STI (&chi;<sup loc=""post"">2</sup>&#8239;=&#8239;6.45, p&#8239;=&#8239;.01), a post-traumatic stress disorder diagnosis (&chi;<sup loc=""post"">2</sup>&#8239;=&#8239;11.84, p&#8239;=&#8239;.001), and a substance use disorder diagnosis (&chi;<sup loc=""post"">2</sup>&#8239;=&#8239;11.32, p&#8239;=&#8239;.001) than high-risk girls. Moderated regression results indicated that YLS/CMI scores significantly predicted future running away among the CSEC group (<italic>&beta;</italic>&#8239;=&#8239;0.23, SE&#8239;=&#8239;.06, <italic>p</italic>&#8239;=&#8239;.02), but not the high-risk group (<italic>&beta;</italic>&#8239;=&#8239;&minus;.008, SE&#8239;=&#8239;.11, <italic>p</italic> =.90). The YLS/CMI shows initial promise for predicting future running away in girls who are CSEC victims. Predicting running away can help identify those at risk for and prevent running away and improve treatment outcomes.

A sample of 440 cases who entered the Child Protective Service in Singapore was analyzed based on eight familial factors on the household and caregiver levels. A four-class solution was found to demonstrate the best fit: (a) the large household group was intergenerational and majority lived with extended family members, (b) the harsh parenting group showed high levels of parenting problems and the caregiver justifying his abuse/neglect, (c) the high criminality group had high levels of caregiver substance abuse and caregiver arrest and incarceration history, and (d) the low disadvantage group rated low on all the familial factors. A Cox Regression revealed that in comparison to the low disadvantage group, the harsh parenting group was twice as likely to have recurrence of harm.

The present study aimed to: (1) identify the distribution of self-reported childhood experiences of maltreatment by urbanicity, (2) assess whether differences by urbanicity persist after adjusting for known risk factors, and (3) explore whether the associations between these risk factors and CM are modified by urban-rural designation. Using nationally representative data from waves I and III of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, the prevalence of six maltreatment outcomes was estimated for rural, minor urban, and major urban areas (N&#8239;=&#8239;14,322). Multivariable logistic models were estimated identifying if risk associated with urbanicity persisted after adjusting for other risk factors. Interactions between urbanicity and main effects were explored. Prevalence estimates of any CM, poly-victimization, supervision neglect, and physical abuse were significantly higher in major urban areas. Those from major urban areas were more likely to report any maltreatment and supervision neglect even after adjusting for child and family risk factors. The association between race/ethnicity, welfare receipt, low parental educational attainment, and disability status and CM were modified by urbanicity. Significant differences in the prevalence and correlates of CM exist between urban and rural areas.

Growing evidence suggests that adversity early in life conveys not only early impacts, but also augments risk of stress-related life course cascades that continue to undermine health. The present study aims to test pathways of stress proliferation and stress embodiment processes linking ACEs to mental health impairment in adulthood. Data are from the 2011 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey, a representative sample of Washington State adults ages 18 and over (N&#8239;=&#8239;14,001). Structural equation modeling allowed for testing of direct and indirect effects from ACEs though low income status, experiences of adversity in adulthood, and social support. The model demonstrated that adult low income, social support and adult adversity are in fact conduits through which ACEs exert their influence on mental health impairment in adulthood. Significant indirect pathways through these variables supported hypotheses that the effect of ACEs is carried through these variables.

The current study draws on 3,430 allegations of CSA in Canada to compare abuse characteristics and judicial outcomes in cases involving adolescent complainants to cases involving child complainants. Adolescent complainants were more likely than child complainants to be abused by a stranger or a person with a community connection to the complainant, while children were more likely than adolescents to be abused by a parent or other relative. Furthermore, compared to child complainants, adolescent complainants were more frequently involved in the most intrusive offenses and their cases were more likely to involve violence. Both groups were most likely to disclose the abuse to a parent, though a greater proportion of children disclosed the abuse to a parent. There were no differences in the delay to disclosure. Accused were equally likely to plead &ldquo;guilty&rdquo; and to be convicted in cases involving child and adolescent complainants. However, offenders convicted of the most intrusive offenses received longer probation sentences when the complainant was a child than when the complainant was an adolescent. These findings have implications for ensuring appropriate support and services to adolescent victims of CSA.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213418300759%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D01d8eb762ead9b0544115a34397f17fa","2018-03-20 11:00:19","57","Child Abuse and Neglect"

We examined whether infants 12 months of age or younger who were described with negative or developmentally unrealistic words were more likely than other infants to have been physically abused. As part of a prospective observational multicenter study investigating bruising and familial psychosocial characteristics, parents were asked to (1) describe their child&rsquo;s personality, and (2) list three words to describe their child. Four independent raters coded parent responses using a qualitative content analysis, identifying descriptors of infants and classifying each as positive, neutral, or negative/unrealistic. A medical expert panel, blinded to the psychosocial data, separately categorized each case as abuse or accident. We then analyzed the potential association between negative/unrealistic descriptors and abusive injury. Of 185 children enrolled, 147 cases (79%) were categorized as accident and 38 (21%) as abuse. Parents used at least one negative/unrealistic descriptor in 35/185 cases (19%), while the remaining 150 cases (81%) included only positive or neutral descriptors. Of the infants described with negative/unrealistic words, 60% were abused, compared to 11% of those described with positive or neutral words (<italic>p&#8239;</italic>&amp;lt;&#8239;.0001; age group-adjusted OR&#8239;=&#8239;9.95; 95% confidence interval [3.98, 24.90]).

Many foster children show mental health problems as they were exposed to an accumulation of risk factors. Hence, foster parents are often faced with challenging parenting situations. The current study focuses on the predictors of foster parents&rsquo; stress and examines longitudinally whether parenting stress is associated with foster parents&rsquo; sensitivity. The sample consisted of 55 children (aged from 1 to 6 years) and their foster caregivers. Foster parents&rsquo; sensitivity was observed during home visits. Caregiver reports were used to assess parenting stress (Parenting Stress Index) as well as foster children&rsquo;s externalizing behavior problems (Child Behavior Checklist). For main caregivers&rsquo; stress at the beginning of placement, regression analyses revealed both, foster children&rsquo;s externalizing problems as well as partners&rsquo; stress as predictive. For main caregivers&rsquo; stress one year after, only initial parenting stress and partners&rsquo; stress were predictive. Foster parents&rsquo; sensitivity was correlated with their parenting stress one year after placement. Regression analyses revealed no longitudinal effects of initial parenting stress on overall sensitivity. However, supportive presence was predicted by initial supportive presence and by the interaction between parenting stress and children&rsquo;s externalizing problems at placement. The findings highlight the role of the partner in experiencing parenting stress when taking care of a foster child. Furthermore, they emphasize that foster parents who care for children with behavior problems need adequate support that can buffer initial parenting stress and thereby promote sensitive caregiving.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213418300735%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D4790e3d07e54d0b115dd651b9939722c","2018-03-20 11:00:19","32","Child Abuse and Neglect"

County-level child maltreatment data were merged with data from the U.S. Census and other publicly-available sources for the 354 counties in four southern states. Results from multiple regression models indicated that, despite a greater preponderance of risk factors typically associated with child maltreatment, rural, majority African-American counties had lower rates of reported and substantiated child maltreatment compared to other southern counties. Cross-sectional results were consistent across three years: 2012, 2013, and 2014.

Costs of CSA were measured from the societal perspective and include health care costs, productivity losses, child welfare costs, violence/crime costs, special education costs, and suicide death costs. We separately estimated quality-adjusted life year (QALY) losses. For each category, we used the best available secondary data to develop cost per case estimates. All costs were estimated in U.S. dollars and adjusted to the reference year 2015. Estimating 20 new cases of fatal and 40,387 new substantiated cases of nonfatal CSA that occurred in 2015, the lifetime economic burden of CSA is approximately $9.3 billion, the lifetime cost for victims of fatal CSA per female and male victim is on average $1,128,334 and $1,482,933, respectively, and the average lifetime cost for victims of nonfatal CSA is of $282,734 per female victim. For male victims of nonfatal CSA, there was insufficient information on productivity losses, contributing to a lower average estimated lifetime cost of $74,691 per male victim. If we included QALYs, these costs would increase by approximately $40,000 per victim. With the exception of male productivity losses, all estimates were based on robust, replicable incidence-based costing methods. The availability of accurate, up-to-date estimates should contribute to policy analysis, facilitate comparisons with other public health problems, and support future economic evaluations of CSA-specific policy and practice. In particular, we hope the availability of credible and contemporary estimates will support increased attention to primary prevention of CSA.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS014521341830084X%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Df571947bbaf3e9c5c1226ba8ee634981","2018-03-20 11:00:19","69","Child Abuse and Neglect"

Overall, findings indicate that prosecution is most strongly predicted by caregiver support and the availability of other evidence. The decision to prosecute was found to include a process of ongoing evaluation of the evidence and determination of a balanced approach to justice. The decision to prosecute a case can be influenced by strong and supportive investigative practices.

The cross-sectional, nationally representative sample of 12,935 cases (mean age&#8239;=&#8239;8.6 years) was pooled from 2008, 2011, and 2014 National Surveys of Children&rsquo;s Exposure to Violence (NatSCEV). Logistic regression models controlling for demographics, socio-economic status, and family structure tested the association between excessive residential mobility, alone, and with LDFs, and past year childhood victimizations (sexual victimization, witnessing community or family violence, maltreatment, physical assault, property crime, and polyvictimization). Nearly 40% of the sample reported at least one LDF. Excessive residential mobility was significantly predictive of increased odds of all but two victimizations; almost all associations were no longer significant after other destabilizing factors were included. The LDF index without residential mobility was significantly predictive of increased odds of all victimizations (AOR&rsquo;s ranged from 1.36 to 1.69), and the adjusted odds ratio indicated a 69% increased odds of polyvictimization for each additional LDF a child experienced. The LDF index thus provides a useful alternative to using residential moves as the sole indicator of instability.

The current effectiveness study investigated symptom reduction after participation in two established group interventions (one community-based psychoeducative intervention; one psychotherapeutic treatment intervention) for children exposed to intimate partner violence and for their non-offending parent. The study included 50 children&mdash;24 girls and 26 boys&mdash;aged 4&ndash;13 years and their mothers. Child and maternal mental health problems and trauma symptoms were assessed pre- and post-treatment.

Despite these improvements, a majority of the children&rsquo;s mothers still reported child trauma symptoms at clinical levels post-treatment. Both interventions substantially reduced maternal post-traumatic stress. The results indicate a need for routine follow-up of children&rsquo;s symptoms after interventions.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213418300784%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D5f1ffe480810d4d162d2e51b6c587315","2018-03-20 11:00:19","37","Child Abuse and Neglect"

Researchers are turning to the field of predictive analytics to optimize data analysis and data-driven decision making. To demonstrate the utility of statistical algorithms that preceded the current predictive analytics, we used Model Based (MOB) recursive partitioning, a variant of regression analysis known as decision trees, on a dataset of cases and controls with a binary outcome of serious maltreatment (defined as hospitalization or death). We ran two models, one which split a robust set of variables significantly correlated with the outcome on the partitioning of a proxy variable for environmental poverty, and one which ran the same variable set partitioned on a variable representing confirmed prior maltreatment. Both models found that what most differentiated children was spending greater than 2% of the timeframe of interest in foster care, and that for some children, lack of Medicaid eligibility almost doubled or tripled the odds of serious maltreatment. We find that decision trees such as MOB can augment risk assessment tools and other data analyses, informing data-driven program and policy decision making. We caution that decision trees, as with any other predictive tool, must be evaluated for inherent biases that may be contained in the proxy variables and the results interpreted carefully.

The need to understand the role of economics in child welfare is critical, given the significant public health costs of child maltreatment. One factor that has been overlooked is regressive taxation. This study addresses this need by examining whether state-level changes in cigarette tax rates predict changes in state-level child maltreatment rates. The results of both a fixed effects (FE) and a fixed effects instrumental variables (FE-IV) estimator show that increases in state cigarette tax rates are followed by increases in child abuse and neglect. An additional test finds that increases in the sales tax (another tax deemed to be regressive) also predict increases in child maltreatment rates.

We analyzed data from 1956 children 2&ndash;17 years old from the Second National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-being. We examined associations of children&rsquo;s predisposing, enabling, and need-related factors and caseworkers&rsquo; work environment characteristics with referral to mental health services. Caseworkers referred 21.0% of children to mental health services. In multivariable analyses controlling for potential covariates, factors associated with increased odds of caseworker referral included: older child age; child sexual abuse (versus neglect); child out-of-home placement; caregiver mental health problems; prior maltreatment reports; clinically significant child behavioral problems; and child welfare agency collaborative ties with mental health providers (all <italic>p</italic>&#8239;&amp;lt;&#8239;.05).

Mounting evidence suggests that participation in at least some types of ECE can mitigate the need for child welfare supervision. Moreover, ECE participation has been linked to positive developmental and school readiness outcomes, lower rates of foster placement, and greater placement stability for children in the CWS. Despite this research, ECE is not widely used by this population. This study informs recent local and federal efforts to increase ECE utilization among children in the CWS by exploring the perspectives of three stakeholder groups (child welfare caseworkers, ECE providers, and parents/caregivers) regarding the benefits of CWS-supervised children&rsquo;s participation in ECE for 1) the children themselves, 2) their parents/caregivers, and 3) their caseworkers.

Propensity score matching was used to compare socially high-risk families with a child born between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2011 who participated in Connecticut&rsquo;s home-visiting program for first-time mothers and a comparison cohort of families who were eligible for the home-visiting program but did not participate. The main outcomes were child maltreatment investigations, substantiations, and out-of-home placements by CPS between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2013. In the unmatched sample, families who participated in home-visiting had significantly higher median risk scores (<italic>P&#8239;&amp;lt;&#8239;</italic>.001). After matching families on measured confounders, the percentages of families with CPS investigations (21.1% vs. 20.9%, <italic>P&#8239;</italic>=&#8239;.86) were similar between the two groups. However, there was a 22% decreased likelihood of CPS substantiations (hazard ratio [HR] 0.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64&ndash;0.95) for families receiving home visiting. First substantiations also occurred later in the child&rsquo;s life among home-visited families. There was a trend toward decreased out-of-home placement (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.53&ndash;1.02, <italic>P&#8239;</italic>=&#8239;.06). These results from a scaled-up statewide program highlight the potential of home visiting as an important approach to preventing child abuse and neglect.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213418300838%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D0d4ce8f16e6226660d4224c8b76645cf","2018-03-20 11:00:20","41","Child Abuse and Neglect"

A statewide implementation in Oklahoma established the effectiveness of SafeCare with a diverse group of parents, which included adolescent parents under 21 years of age, a particularly at-risk group. The current study examined whether SafeCare is also effective for this subsample of 294 adolescent parents with regard to child welfare recidivism, depression and child abuse potential, and attainment of service goals. Post-treatment adolescent parent ratings of program engagement and satisfaction were also examined. Among the subsample of adolescent parents, the SafeCare intervention did not result in significantly improved outcomes in terms of preventing recidivism or reduction in risk factors associated with child abuse and neglect as compared to child welfare services as usual. Further, no significant differences in program engagement and satisfaction between SafeCare and services as usual were detected. These findings shed light on the potential differences in program effectiveness between adolescent and adult parents, and the need for future research to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of behavioral parenting programs with adolescent parents.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213418300693%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Db675da402d13c5201be3d0cd8410cb82","2018-03-20 11:00:20","42","Child Abuse and Neglect"

Protective factors that affect the relationship between child maltreatment and adult depressive symptoms are underexplored. Guided by emotion regulation theory and the perspective of positive psychology, we examined the roles of self-compassion and gratitude as protective factors in the relationship between child maltreatment and adult depressive symptoms in a sample of 358 college students. Results showed that psychological maltreatment (emotional abuse and emotional neglect) was associated with adult depressive symptoms through decreased self-compassion. Neglect (emotional neglect and physical neglect) and sexual abuse were associated with adult depressive symptoms through decreased gratitude. There was no association between physical abuse and depressive symptoms through either self-compassion or gratitude.

Interviews with six officers, of varying rank, were conducted to explore the nature, prevalence and causes of mental health issues amongst colleagues. Data was analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis to draw out key themes. Results indicate that whilst mental health issues are pervasive amongst police, many avoid seeking help due to a culture of invincibility, and a fear of impeding their career progression. The cause of distress was principally attributed to organizational bureaucracy; the impact of exposure to trauma was consistently minimized. Participants were critical of formal support mechanisms, and felt the absence of social spaces at work impeded collegiate support, and caused feelings of isolation. Findings highlight the need for a cultural shift, at both an individual and organizational level. Education is needed to counter the stigma of psychological distress amongst officers. Furthermore, mechanisms of formal and informal support should be reviewed as a priority.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay016/4948685?rss=1","2018-03-21 11:00:37","73","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"

                  <p>The present study is an analysis of a Czech political corruption network known as the Rath affairreconstructed with publicly available data. We argue that for the study of criminal networks it is fruitful tofollow a multiplex approach, i.e., to distinguish several interdependent network dimensions and study howthey are interrelated. Relational elements in corruption are identified, and we propose three dimensions thatare essential for understanding the Rath network: pre-existing ties (e.g., marriage or co-membership of thesame party), resource transfer (e.g., bribing), and collaboration (e.g., communication).The aim of the study was threefold. We aimed to examine if the network exhibits the core/periphery structure,to investigate the multiplex structure of the network by assessing the overlap of the main dimensions of thenetwork, and to determine the central and multiplex actors while considering the differentiation of centralityaccording to the three network dimensions. The core/periphery model appears to have a perfect fit to theaggregated network, leading to a four-block adjacency matrix. Studying the frequency of ties in these blocksshows that collaboration ties are present in all the blocks, while resource transfer ties are mainly locatedbetween the core and periphery, and pre-existing ties are rare generally. We also identify central actors,none of which are strategically positioned, occupying more visible positions instead. The majority of actors display strong multiplexity in the composition of their own ties. In the conclusion the potential usefulness ofmultiplex descriptive measures and of mixed methods approaches, implications of our results for trust incriminal networks, and potential merits of analytical sociology approach are discussed.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12117-018-9334-y","2018-03-22 04:15:37","80","Trends in Organized Crime"

                  <p>Media coverage of water pollution has been a topic of theoretical examination and empirical testing. Still, green criminologists have not fully explored issues relating to water pollution. This paper draws from the environmental literature on risk society and criminology&rsquo;s crime news frame to explore media coverage of corporate deviance through the lens of green cultural criminology. A content analysis of local newspaper articles in a southeastern city analyzes constructions of corporate deviance, risk, and blame regarding the discovery of GenX. Results demonstrate how media discourse around risk and science plays an important role in shaping concerns about corporate environmental pollution. Magnification of risk and uncertainty draws the public&rsquo;s attention to issues of regulatory enforcement and funding. At the same time, risk is minimized by corporate and regulatory officials who urge the public to wait for more research before introducing new laws and regulations while also individualizing the blame.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10612-018-9389-8","2018-03-22 07:15:18","36","Critical Criminology"

For this reason, it is imperative to understand spatio-temporal influences of the landscape to assist police in the understanding of localized crime problems. The current study focuses on Little Rock, AR, which had the 7th highest violent crime rate and the 4th highest property crime rate with cities over 100k persons in 2015. We utilized risk terrain modelling to identify significant criminogenic features of the landscape by police shift and division. This framework demonstrates how risk varies and can be accounted for based on policing practices; thus, informing police of significant risk factors they can approach to develop tailored risk reduction strategies. Each police division represents a unique environment, influencing crime differently due to the way features of the landscape collocate to produce risky areas. Findings are discussed with regards to risk-based policing and implications for practitioners.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay018/4951667?rss=1","2018-03-22 12:00:36","119","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"

                  <p>The UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 is the first national legislation to use the term &lsquo;modern slavery&rsquo; and to explicitly target &lsquo;slavery&rsquo; as opposed to &lsquo;human trafficking&rsquo;, &lsquo;forced labour&rsquo;, or other terms. This article explains the development of UK modern slavery policy, which did not arise as a rational response to a defined problem, but has gradually emerged from the policy process as a moderately structured problem. Problem structuring took place in two phases. The first phase was marked by a series of problematisations and policy responses, with disjunctions between the constructed policy problem and the social problem. Elite problematisations excluded alternatives, although the final shape of policy remained open. Policy built up incrementally, running ahead of research so that the policy frame was limited to sexual exploitation while marginalising labour exploitation concerns. In the second phase, unresolved problems of legislation were questioned under the influence of a new moralistic policy frame, an international discourse on slavery, supported by elite political actors. Campaign groups and licit industry also became more influential, increasing the policy scope to take in more types of exploitation. This generated a second round of legislative problematisation, ultimately embedded in the Modern Slavery Act 2015. The two-phase process and prevailing top-down policy direction worked against human rights discourses and victim protection. Modern slavery remains a moderately structured problem, with more work necessary to address unintended consequences and implementation difficulties, including enhancing multi-agency working.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10610-018-9375-4","2018-03-22 22:30:20","102","European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research"

Nevertheless, there are still gaps in sound knowledge regarding factors that could protect children from being cyberbullies or cybervictims. The current systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to overcome limitations of previous studies on risk factors to establish if and how empathy is related to the different cyberbullying roles. After exhaustive searches with rigorous inclusion and exclusion criteria, 25 studies were included. Cyberbullying perpetration was found to be related to low empathy (OR&#8239;=&#8239;1.5) and this relationship held also after controlling for covariates (OR&#8239;=&#8239;1.3) but cyber-victimization was not significantly related to empathy (OR&#8239;=&#8239;0.94). There were some indicators that cybervictims could have high empathy, but more research is needed to clarify this relationship. Results are presented also separately for the relationship between affective and cognitive empathy and different cyberbullying roles. There were not enough studies to draw conclusions about the relationship between empathy and being a cyberbully/victim or defender, but some tendencies were found and described.

"10089","""They Chase Us Like Dogs"": Exploring the Vulnerabilities of ""Ladyboys"" in the Cambodian Sex Trade","<p>While the vulnerability of women and girls continues to be the subject of research and concern among social service providers, few attempts have been made to understand the vulnerabilities and lived experiences of transgender persons in the sex industry. Among the studies that have been done, most have focused on sexual health and their likelihood to contract or spread HIV/AIDS, often ignoring other potential vulnerabilities. This study aims to provide a broad baseline of data on the perspectives and experiences of transgendered persons in the sex trade in Phnom Penh, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of their needs, and vulnerabilities, including their trajectory into sex work and potential alternatives. In addition, this study aims to aid the development of programming and social services that meet their needs holistically, looking beyond gender expression and social identity to address often overlooked needs and vulnerabilities. This study notes the respondent&rsquo;s common personal feelings of self-blame, shame, and guilt, and discusses a perceived fatalism observed within the social identity of transgender persons in the Cambodian sex trade, and the impact this may have on their perception of alternative employment, future options, and vulnerability to violence. The majority of respondents, or 74%, indicate sexual harassment, and 40% cite physical assault within the past 12 months, as well as more than half of respondents (55%) who cite being forced to have sex against their wishes. In addition, respondents describe diverse and overlapping forms of stigma and discrimination including: loss of employment (39%) and loss or denial of housing (20%), denial of education (12%) and denial of basic health services (10%) as a result of being transgender. Over half of those citing stigma and discrimination and more than one-third of those citing physical assault, cite police as the perpetrators of the violence. This study notes the respondent&rsquo;s common personal feelings of self-blame, shame, and guilt, and discusses a perceived fatalism observed within the social identity of transgender persons in the Cambodian sex trade, and the impact this may have on their perception of alternative employment, future options, and vulnerability to violence.</p>","http://digitalcommons.uri.edu/dignity/vol3/iss2/1","2018-03-23 14:30:24","37","Dignity: A Journal on Sexual Exploitation and Violence"

Currently, there are a number of sexual violence prevention programs that have been developed to lower rates of victimization, increase awareness, and connect victims with resources. Within this area of research, there has been less focus on effective methods of program dissemination. For example, school-based sexual violence prevention programs have had positive outcomes; however, little is known about how these programs are disseminated. The train-the-trainer model of dissemination utilizes master trainers to equip others to implement programs, thereby allowing more adults to teach and subsequently more children to receive the program. This study used survey data from teachers and other school personnel (<italic>n</italic>&#8239;=&#8239;127) to analyze the utility of a train-the-trainer model of dissemination for a sexual violence prevention program in the state of Hawai&rsquo;i. Through responses of people who were trained to implement the program (59.8% of whom did implement), aspects of the training, the program itself, and factors affecting whether a person implemented the program were explored. Results suggest that time spent in training, job position, and time in that position predicted whether a person trained to implement the sexual violence prevention program followed through with teaching the program to students. Additionally, 54.7% of people who did implement the program had at least one student disclose sexual violence to them, indicating the importance of sexual violence prevention programming and dissemination of these programs.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213418301261%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Da426290d1a9d82a4390ad41ee7a138aa","2018-03-24 11:00:20","46","Child Abuse and Neglect"

The majority of research in this area has focused on children who have experienced severe psychosocial deprivation; it is not clear whether typical variation in neglect experienced in community samples would have the same neurobiological consequences as those documented in extreme samples. The present study examined the associations among self-reported childhood neglect, amygdala volume, and anxiety symptoms in a community sample of 138 adolescents ages 9&ndash;15 years (43% male). Linear mixed modeling yielded a three-way interaction of neglect, sex, and brain hemisphere, reflecting a significant positive association between neglect and right amygdala volume in boys. Additional analyses indicated that right amygdala volume significantly mediated the association between neglect and anxiety symptoms in boys. These findings are consistent with previous reports of larger amygdala volumes in previously institutionalized children, and with documented associations between caregiving deprivation and anxiety symptoms. The results suggest that the effects of childhood neglect on limbic structures are sex-specific and lateralized, and provide support for a neural mechanism relating childhood neglect to later difficulties in emotional functioning.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213418301200%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D86c3668be275a0a6d5b92bf37d7bd315","2018-03-24 11:00:20","37","Child Abuse and Neglect"

It was hypothesized that: (a) poor executive functions (i.e., working memory problems and inhibition/switching problems) would be associated with higher levels of emotion regulation difficulties and CPA risk; (b) emotion regulation difficulties would be positively associated with CPA risk; and (c) emotion regulation difficulties would partially explain the association between executive functions (i.e., working memory problems and inhibition/switching problems) and CPA risk. To examine these predictions, a sample of 133 general population parents (31% fathers) completed self-report measures of CPA risk, emotion regulation difficulties, working memory problems, and a performance-based measure of inhibition/switching skills. Results revealed that executive functioning problems were linked with emotion regulation difficulties, which in turn were associated with CPA risk. Moreover, emotion regulation difficulties explained the relationship between executive functions (working memory, inhibition/switching) and CPA risk. The final model accounted for 41% of the variance in CPA risk. Although additional research is needed, the present findings suggest that enhancing parents&rsquo; executive functioning and teaching them effective emotion regulation skills may be important targets for CPA prevention efforts.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213418301078%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D1966884c93111479c25ca726ba710061","2018-03-25 12:00:21","31","Child Abuse and Neglect"

"10151","Low Policeâ€“public Social Distance As the Key to Recruiting1","<span><div>Abstract</div>Police agencies have cited difficulty recruiting qualified candidates, especially minority and women applicants. This may be because minorities and women less often have friends who are police officers or know a police officer by name who they can call upon for assistance. The extent and nature of the association between the police and the public is one way to measure police&ndash;public social distance&mdash;the subjective perception of closeness or lack thereof the public feels with their police. Given the low public opinions of police among minority populations and negative media coverage resulting from police use of force incidents, low social distance may be one way police agencies can attract more women and minority applicants. This assertion was tested by surveying a sample of 533 university students in the fall of 2015. As a whole, respondents were more likely to report wanting to be a police officer when they had a police officer in the family or as a friend&mdash;with one exception. While having a family member or friend who is a police officer were not significantly related to women&rsquo;s desire to seek a career in policing, knowing a police officer by name reached significance. Men, especially non-Hispanic white men, also were more likely to report wanting to be a police officer. Proactive and targeted recruitment strategies that decrease social distance between the police and the public can help attract qualified women and minority candidates, thus contributing to the diversity of police agencies.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay020/4954038?rss=1","2018-03-26 13:47:35","74","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"

                  <p>China has been under international pressure for the death sentences meted out to foreigners for drug-related offenses. Domestically, the sentencing of foreign offenders is perceived to be too lenient compared to that of the natives under similar circumstances. We discuss the due process protections in processing foreigners charged and convicted for capital drug offenses within the context of international law. Further, to empirically assess the sentencing of such cases, we use a sample of 192 cases including both offender groups to examine the role of citizenship status, case characteristics, and defense arguments on the outcome of either an immediate or suspended death sentence. Findings indicate that foreign offenders raise different defense arguments compared to that of native offenders; but citizenship status does not play a key role in the multivariate model; rather the number of defense arguments accepted by the court and the processing time help predict the sentencing outcome.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10610-018-9377-2","2018-03-26 16:46:12","35","European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research"

                  <p>The criminal career paradigm is a major research area but has largely overlooked federal offenders and federal data. Drawing on a population of federal supervised release clients in the Midwestern United States, the current study examined the predictive validity of the federal Post-Conviction Risk Assessment (PCRA) and its subscales for their association with six parameters of the criminal career. Poisson, negative binomial, and logistic regression models showed that PCRA Risk was significantly associated with annual offending rate (lambda), chronicity, prison misconduct, noncompliance on supervised release, having a warrant requested on supervised release, and career criminal status. Various PCRA subscales also were significantly associated with criminal career outcomes especially for current community supervision outcomes. These effects withstood confounding effects for age, sex, race, age of arrest onset, federal criminal history rank, and total prison exposure. The study supported basic criminal career findings using federal data and showed that a standard risk assessment actuarial in the federal system has utility as an indicator of the criminal career.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12103-018-9436-8","2018-03-27 08:15:10","39","American Journal of Criminal Justice"

                  <p>The present studies examined jurors&rsquo; perceptions of &ldquo;familiar&rdquo; identifications&mdash;that is, identifications where an eyewitness espouses prior exposure to the perpetrator. In two studies, undergraduate mock jurors (total <em>N</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;760) read a criminal case vignette that manipulated whether the eyewitness claimed to have prior exposure to the perpetrator (and how much). Study 1 additionally manipulated the eyewitness&rsquo; subsequent lineup identification confidence level, finding that confidence (but not familiarity) increased participants&rsquo; beliefs in guilt and identification accuracy. Study 2 employed a stronger familiarity manipulation while additionally manipulating how long before the crime the prior exposure occurred and the viewing conditions during the crime. Results indicated that this stronger familiar identification was perceived as more accurate and indicative of guilt than the stranger identification, but only in cases of minimal prior exposure. And while viewing conditions independently affected legal judgments, it rarely moderated these familiarity effects. Theoretical and applied implications are discussed.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9266-0","2018-03-27 08:17:17","35","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"

                  <p>Although several studies have investigated the socio-cultural underpinnings of intimate partner violence (IPV) in Ghana, few explore the help-seeking behavior of the victims. This study examined the help-seeking behavior of female victims of IPV in Ghana. Specifically, it explored the role of perceived risk of injury and trust in determining whether and where victims seek help and their likelihood of seeking help in the event of future abuse. The study used nationally representative cross-sectional data (<em>N</em>&nbsp;=&thinsp;1689) and logit regression techniques to address these research objectives. The majority of respondents who had suffered IPV had not sought help after experiencing violence. However, of these, a substantial proportion said they would do so in the future. Respondents with high perceived risk of injury from physical and emotional violence were significantly more likely to seek help from both formal and informal support networks than those who saw themselves at no risk. Those with high levels of trust in formal and informal institutions were more likely to seek help from these networks. Compared to those who did not, respondents who thought IPV should be kept private were less likely to seek help, especially in future abuse. Finding suggest policy makers should educate women about IPV, especially their risk of violence.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-9959-2","2018-03-28 09:16:49","37","Journal of Family Violence"

One of the practices that fosters community involvement in offender treatment is the Volunteer Probation Officer (VPO) system. VPOs are community volunteers who are appointed as part-time government officials to support the work of professional probation officers. VPOs support the work of professional probation officers by supervising and assisting offenders in the communities in which they live. VPOs are key individuals who facilitate the rehabilitation of offenders as well as the acceptance of the offender by the community. However, in line with social and cultural changes, the Japanese VPO system is facing several challenges such as weaker bonds of the community and decreasing number of VPOs. In response, the Rehabilitation Bureau of the Ministry of Justice has implemented a number of measures, including the establishment of Offender Rehabilitation Support Centers and the creation of a new compensation scheme for property damage or injury suffered by VPOs or their family members. In many countries, VPOs and other volunteers play an important role in helping offenders reintegrate into the community. Comparing and learning from the approaches of other countries are important steps to enhance the effectiveness of probation through volunteers&rsquo; activities.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS1756061618300739%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Dca23eb35c423e52f4229417d1301d530","2018-03-28 14:16:11","48","International Journal of Law, Crime and Justice"

                  <p>Crime victimization and fear of crime have been studied extensively in the extant literature, but very few studies have been carried out in sub-Saharan Africa. Using a sample of 523 students from a leading university in Nairobi, Kenya, we found that females, older students, and prior crime victims are more fearful of crime at school, of crime in the community, and of overall crime. In addition, we found that incivility, measured as the perceived prevalence of drug use among Kenyans, was also statistically significantly related to fear of crime at school, fear of crime in the community, and the overall measure of fear of crime. These findings are consistent with findings from the extant literature, mainly from the United States. Thus, we argue that the correlates of fear of crime appear to be similar in different geopolitical contexts. The implications of the findings for campus safety and security are discussed.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1057/s41284-018-0134-5","2018-03-28 17:18:09","48","Security Journal"

                  <span>
                    <h3>Objectives</h3>
                    <p>The project aims to: (1) investigate structural and functional changes in an Australian drug trafficking network across time to determine ways in which such networks form and evolve. To meet this aim, the project will answer the following research questions: (1) What social structural changes occur in drug trafficking networks across time? (2) How are these structural changes related to roles/tasks performed by network members? (3) What social processes can account for change over time in drug trafficking networks?</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Method</h3>
                    <p>The relational data on the network was divided into four two years periods. Actors were allocated to specific roles. We applied a stochastic actor-oriented model to explain the dynamics of the network across time. Using RSiena, we estimated a number of models with the key objectives of investigating: (1) the effect of roles only; (2) the endogenous effect of degree-based popularity (Matthew effect); (3) the endogenous effect of balancing connectivity with exposure (preference for indirect rather than direct connections); (4) how degree-based popularity is moderated by tendencies towards reach and exposure.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>Preferential attachment is completely moderated by a preference for having indirect ties, meaning that centralization is a result of actors preferring indirect connections to many others and not because of a preference for connecting to popular actors. Locally, actors seek cohesive relationships through triadic closure.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>Actors do not seek to create an efficient network that is highly centralized at the expense of security. Rather, actors strive to optimize security through triadic closure, building trust, and protecting themselves and actors in close proximity through the use of brokers that offer access to the rest of the network.</p>

                  <p>Too often, human rights are treated as an unconditional good and thus beyond politics. Yet human rights have always existed within an identified political context. Today, this context is neoliberalism. However, while criminologists often allude to various shortcomings of international human rights and humanitarian law, little consideration has been given to the neoliberal undercurrents of contemporary human rights discourse and practice. This article argues that neoliberalism and the human rights movement exist in a symbiotic, co-constitutive relationship. Against the neoliberal hold on human rights, the article points to an alternative political foundation, Action-Based Human Rights. The action-based model aims to be a platform for resistance and to root human rights in action and opportunities for agency and self-representation. The article suggests a preliminary path to how criminologists can begin to advance this alternative.

Nevertheless, every day thousands of people around the world are sold, lured with false promises and exploited. In Mexico, 10,000 young girls and women are said to be trafficked into cities for sexual exploitation every year. Trafficked victims suffer a wide range of sexual exploitation, physical and psychological violence, human rights violations including their right to dignity, and cruel and inhumane treatment, creating vulnerability and isolation. To cope, many victims adopt harmful sexual and non-sexual behaviors, which we discuss in this paper. For this study, we gathered information from 70 trafficked victims in Monterrey, Mexico. We found that trafficked women and children are forced into high-risk sexual and non-sexual behaviors. Many of them use drugs, alcohol, and marijuana. Their sexual behaviors indicate that many victims are coerced into high-risk sexual practices including having multiple sexual partners.</p>","http://digitalcommons.uri.edu/dignity/vol3/iss2/3","2018-03-30 01:45:54","32","Dignity: A Journal on Sexual Exploitation and Violence"

"10246","Lessons to Be Drawn From U.s. Drug Control Policies","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>U.S. drug policy has sometimes implicitly &mdash; and incorrectly &mdash; assumed that all drug-related harm is caused by drug use, so reducing drug use necessarily reduces drug harm proportionately. Instead, drug policy should try to reduce the sum of both harms incident to drug consumption &mdash; including harms to users as well as harms to others &mdash; and policy-generated harm in the form of illicit markets, enforcement costs, and increased harmfulness of drug-taking due to controls. A strict prohibition can meet these criteria when it succeeds in keeping illicit markets &ldquo;thin&rdquo; and consumption very low. However, promulgating wise policies toward &ldquo;thick&rdquo; markets with widespread consumption necessarily involves trade-offs among competing objectives. Recent U.S. history illustrates both the futility of trying to control already &ldquo;thick&rdquo; markets using very long prison sentences for dealers (as in the cocaine market) and the risks of allowing &ldquo;thin&rdquo; markets to &ldquo;thicken&rdquo; by neglecting regulatory and enforcement efforts as prevalence starts to rise (as in the market for prescription opioids).</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10610-018-9376-3","2018-03-30 10:31:07","40","European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research"

                  <p>This paper finds qualified support for the use of Skarbek&rsquo;s (<span>2011</span>, <span>2014</span>) governance theory to understand the emergence of prison gang-like groups in Kyrgyzstan, Northern Ireland and Brazil. However, Skarbek&rsquo;s (<span>2011</span>, <span>2014</span>) governance theory has little to say about how many prison gangs emerge and how they organise comparatively outside the US context. This paper argues that variation in the number of gangs and their monopolization of informal governance can only be explained by considering importation and deprivation theories alongside governance theories. These theories factor in variation in prison environments and pre-existing societal divisions imported into prison, which affect the costs on information transmission and incentives for gang expansion. In particular, the paper pays attention to the wider role social and political processes play in influencing whether monopoly power by prison gangs is supported and legitimized or not.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12117-018-9338-7","2018-03-30 11:47:52","99","Trends in Organized Crime"

In view of this, this article examined the situational and contextual factors sustaining police impersonation in Nigeria. Situational choice theory was employed as conceptual framework. The existence of six major conditions in Nigeria is encouraging criminally-minded individuals to illegally take-up police identity. Police impersonation is inhibiting the service delivery capacity of the Nigerian police officials in a number of ways. Therefore, it becomes highly imperative for the Nigeria Police Force to design a holistic framework to effectively control the physical and cyber activities of impersonators using police identity to perpetrate different forms of crime.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay024/4956950?rss=1","2018-03-30 13:47:27","49","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"

                  <p>Criminal justice responses to sexual violence have long been critiqued for either failing or further victimizing complainants. The ways that police can be complicit in these shortcomings is well documented, but less is known about how police officers themselves identify and understand the barriers to justice within the criminal justice system. In this article, we use data from 70 semi-structured interviews and two focus groups with sex crime investigators to explore police interpretations of the obstacles to achieving justice in cases of sexual violence. Our findings demonstrate that the majority of officers are critical of the present criminal justice response to sexual violence and are doubtful of its ability to provide a semblance of justice to the majority of victims.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10612-018-9390-2","2018-03-31 16:15:53","117","Critical Criminology"

                  <p>Bystander-based violence prevention interventions have shown efficacy to reduce dating violence and sexual violence acceptance at the individual level yet no large randomized controlled trial (RCT) has evaluated this effect at the high-school level and over time. This rigorous cluster-randomized controlled trial addresses this gap by evaluating intervention effectiveness at both school and individual levels. Kentucky high schools were randomized to intervention or control conditions. In intervention schools educators provided school-wide &lsquo;Green Dot&rsquo; presentations and bystander training with student popular opinion leaders. Each spring from 2010 to 2014; 73,044 students completed anonymous surveys with no missing data on relevant outcomes. Dating violence and sexual violence acceptance were the primary outcomes for this analysis. At the school level, slopes from linear mixed models using averaged school-level dating violence acceptance (condition&ndash;time, <em>p</em>&thinsp;&lt;&thinsp;0.001) and sexual violence acceptance (condition&ndash;time interaction, <em>p</em>&thinsp;&lt;&thinsp;0.001) differed indicating a significant reduction in the violence acceptance in the intervention relative to control schools over time and specifically in years 3 and 4 when &lsquo;Green Dot&rsquo; was fully implemented. Analyses based on student&rsquo;s self-reported receipt of &lsquo;Green Dot&rsquo; training by condition confirmed the school level finding of significant reductions in both dating violence and sexual violence acceptance in years 3 and 4 for both males and females. In this RCT we find evidence that the bystander-based violence prevention intervention &lsquo;Green Dot&rsquo; works, as hypothesized and as implemented, to reduce acceptance of dating violence and sexual violence at the school and individual levels.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-9961-8","2018-04-02 20:02:00","51","Journal of Family Violence"

                  <p>The policing profession has recently experienced events that affected officers across the nation. Several high-profile cases involving police and members of minority communities intensified the tensions among these groups. Amid public criticisms of policing, law enforcement officers have become targets of attacks. Multiple cases of officer ambushes and assassinations have further troubled the already stressful occupational position of law enforcement. This study investigates what coping strategies officers used after the deadly attacks on police in Dallas, Texas and Baton Rouge, Louisiana that occurred in July, 2016. We also investigate how the coping strategies used affects job motivation among officers. Our findings suggest officers turned to three coping strategies: support networks, stoic self-help, and self-medication. These coping strategies were found to be ineffective mechanisms for protecting officer job motivation; however, some strategies adversely affected motivation more than others. Understanding how officers are coping and why effective strategies are not being employed adequately is imperative for both the safety of officers and the public.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12103-018-9437-7","2018-04-02 21:15:10","53","American Journal of Criminal Justice"
"10267","Evaluations of Police Reforms: Utility Or Futility?","<span><div>Abstract</div>In recent years, four Nordic countries have implemented large-scale police reforms. Reforms have been evaluated and the present article discusses the merits of such processes. Three topics are discussed: first, it is argued that such evaluations are by nature of limited methodological rigour. The common model of nationwide implementation at one point in time limits possibilities for more sophisticated models of evaluation. Second, due to the nature of such evaluations, they are of limited value as a tool for organizational reorganization. In fact, organizational response to evaluation may take the form of denial rather than change. Third, it might be assumed that countries planning major police reforms would study such evaluations in detail and revise their plans accordingly, but available evidence from Norway and Sweden suggests otherwise. The article concludes with a discussion whether it would be possible to devise evaluations in ways that would increase their worth and impact.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay023/4959182?rss=1","2018-04-03 08:47:24","130","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"

                  <p>In recent years, the field of crime prediction has drawn increasing attention in Japan. However, predicting crime in Japan is especially challenging because the crime rate is considerably lower than that of other developed countries, making the development of a statistical model for crime prediction quite difficult. Risk terrain modeling (RTM) may be the most suitable method, as it depends mainly on the environmental factors associated with crime and does not require past crime data. In this study, we applied RTM to cases of theft from vehicles in Fukuoka, Japan, in 2014 and evaluated the predictive performance (hit rate and predictive accuracy index) in comparison to other crime prediction techniques, including KDE, ProMap, and SEPP, which use past crime occurrences to predict future crime. RTM was approximately twice as effective as the other techniques. Based on the results, we discuss the merits of and drawbacks to using RTM in Japan.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10610-018-9378-1","2018-04-03 14:16:09","81","European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research"

"10290","Bridging the Gaps By Including the Police Officer Perspective? A Study of the Design and Implementation of An Rct in Police Practice and the Impact of Pracademic Knowledge","<span><div>Abstract</div>One means of advancing police research is to examine the implementation of studies conducted in the field of police practice. The design and implementation of experiments in police practice is complex because they require the two often separate worlds of research and practice to work together. One way to move forward towards evidence-based policing would be to bridge the gap between research and practice, while also bridging the gap between practice and policy. This article analyses how a randomized controlled trial was designed and implemented in the field of drug policing in Sweden. The analysis is done by comparing the drug enforcement trial to the experimental guidelines presented by Sherman (2010) and by exploring survey responses provided by participating police officers. The study identifies three themes with special relevance for the pracademic perspective; frustration, credibility, and officer perspective. The study concludes that the involvement of pracademic researchers may facilitate better communication between practitioners and police management, enhance evaluation, and improve the chances of changing police practice.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay022/4960026?rss=1","2018-04-04 08:47:13","160","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"

Police encounters with PMI included youth and ethnic minorities, and were often characterized by substance abuse and self-harm. Over half of the encounters were resolved formally by police making Mental Health Act (MHA) apprehensions, though less than half of these apprehensions resulted in hospital admission. Indicators of PMI self-harm, abrupt cessation of medication by PMI, and police contact initiated by civilians or service providers (e.g. paramedics) increased the likelihood of MHA apprehensions. Police made mental health referrals during 40% of informally resolved incidents.

                  <p>This article is based on 4 Dutch Crime Pattern Analyses on money laundering reports. These reports are part of a four-yearly cycle that provides a periodic overview on organized crime in the Netherlands. The reports cover a time span of 12&nbsp;years, starting from 2004 till 2016. During this time period, stricter anti-money laundering laws and more awareness of, and subsequently, attention to the profits of organized crime, had led to a growing number of confiscations and convictions for money laundering. Although the Crime Pattern Analyses on money laundering reports are unsuitable to study displacement effects or other situational changes (lacking precise data), they are useful as a tool for comparison and further policy research. Findings show that several changes in money laundering methods and new types of facilitators did occur. Technology is the biggest driver behind the identified changes. However, it also turns out that over the years the same money laundering methods keep returning. In such cases, no innovation was found. Even with the advent of digital opportunities and crypto currencies, cash was still extensively used. The continuity in money laundering methods suggests that the risk of detection is quite low or the consequences are negligible.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10610-018-9379-0","2018-04-05 13:15:53","40","European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research"

                  <p>Social science has frequently examined the relationships between school environment and delinquency, mental health and delinquency, and school environment and mental health. However, little to no research to date has examined the interrelationship between these variables simultaneously, especially at it relates specifically to delinquent acts committed at school. The current study uses data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) to look at the interrelationship between these variables. What is found in this data is that the relationship between negative mental health states and delinquency at school, specifically measured as depressive symptoms and gun carrying at school, respectively, is possibly a spurious one, wherein both of these variables are partly shaped by school attachment, which accounts for their correlation.

We conducted prospective analyses of secondary data to determine the effects of neighborhood collective efficacy and parental spanking on household Child Protective Services (CPS) involvement, and whether spanking mediates the relationship between neighborhood collective efficacy and CPS involvement. The sample (<italic>N</italic>&#8239;=&#8239;2,267) was drawn from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS), a stratified random sample of 4,789 births between 1998&ndash;2000 in 20 large U.S. cities. Logistic regression models were employed to test the effects of neighborhood collective efficacy and spanking at child age 3 on mother&rsquo;s report of CPS contact during the subsequent two years. The product-of-coefficient approach was used to test the mediation hypothesis. One aspect of neighborhood collective efficacy (i.e., Social Cohesion/Trust) is associated with lower odds of CPS involvement (OR&#8239;=&#8239;.80, 95% CI 0.670&ndash;0.951) after controlling for Informal Social Control, parental spanking, and the covariates.

It encompasses three dimensions: an overwhelming exhaustion related to one&rsquo;s parental role, an emotional distancing from one&rsquo;s children and a sense of ineffectiveness in one&rsquo;s parental role. This study aims to facilitate further identification of the consequences of parental burnout for the parents themselves, their spouses and their child(ren). In a sample of 1551 parents, we examined the relationship between parental burnout and seven possible consequences: escapism and suicidal thoughts, addictions, sleep disorders, marital conflicts, a partner estrangement mindset, and neglect and violence towards one&rsquo;s child(ren). We examined (1) to what extent parental and job burnout related to each of these possible consequences and (2) whether parental burnout is specifically related to neglectful and violent behaviour towards one&rsquo;s child(ren). The results suggest that parental burnout has a statistically similar effect to job burnout on addictions and sleep problems, a stronger effect on couples&rsquo; conflicts and partner estrangement mindset and a specific effect on child-related outcomes (neglect and violence) and escape and suicidal ideation.

Regression analyses revealed that under low cognitive load, attachment avoidance and mindfulness predicted quicker identification of fear (i.e., with less perceptual information), whereas anxiety predicted slower identification of fear (i.e., with more perceptual information). In the high cognitive load condition, emotional maltreatment and mindfulness predicted quicker identification of fear, and anxiety and mindfulness predicted faster identification of emotions overall.

This study aimed to examine the association between exposure to childhood maltreatment, socio-demographic factors, and students&rsquo; mental health status and self-esteem. A cross-sectional study enrolled a representative sample of 1270 students from Kuwait University. An anonymous self-administered questionnaire included students&rsquo; socio-demographic characteristics, history of exposure to childhood physical and/or emotional maltreatment, DASS-21 to assess mental health status, and Rosenberg self-esteem scale was used. Chi-square test and binary logistic regression models were applied. The study found that among participants, 49.6%(95% CI: 64.8%&ndash;52.4%), 63.0%(95% CI: 60.3%&ndash;65.7%), and 43.8%(95% CI: 41.1%&ndash;46.6%) reported having depression, anxiety, and stress respectively. Moreover, 22.5%(95% CI: 20.1%&ndash;24.8%) and 18.6%(95% CI:16.5%&ndash;20.9%) reported childhood physical and emotional maltreatment, respectively; while 12.7% reported both. Multivariate analysis revealed that experiencing childhood physical and emotional maltreatment were independent contributors to reporting depression and anxiety; while exposure to only emotional maltreatment contributed to reporting stress. Gender, GPA, childhood enrollment in private/public schools, number of close friends, were other contributors to mental health problems. Participants&rsquo; median score of self-esteem was 17/30, and only childhood emotional maltreatment was a significant predictor to low self-esteem after adjustment for other confounders. Mental health problems, and experiencing childhood physical and emotional maltreatment were prevalent relatively high among university students. Childhood corporal and emotional maltreatment were independent predictors to adolescents and young adults&rsquo; mental health problems. Experiencing childhood emotional maltreatment predicted low self-esteem.

In the present study, after identifying a sample of 12 men convicted of online grooming, we used qualitative grounded theory through in-depth interviews and comparisons with the proven facts of their convictions. The results show how aggressors actively study the structural environment, the needs and vulnerabilities of the minors). In this way, the aggressors adapt by using most effective strategies of persuasion at all times, so that the child feels like an active part of the plot. This allows the aggressors to have sexual interactions with minors either online or offline and in a sporadic or sustained manner. This process is maintained with some distorted perceptions about minors and the abuse process, which seem to feed back to the beginning of the cycle with other potential victims. The interaction between the persuasive processes and the distorted perceptions of the aggressor leads to a potential work focus for treatment as well as detection and prevention.

Semi-structured, qualitative interviews were conducted with 25 men living in an urban area in Ontario who had spent more than 30 consecutive nights in an emergency shelter over the course of their housing histories. During data analysis, it was observed that all of the men had experienced some form of trauma or neglect in childhood which contributed to their entries into homelessness. Using a case study approach, three entry pathways into long term homelessness are described: 1) youth; 2) emerging or early adulthood; and 3) middle adulthood. Participants are classified into the pathways by the developmental period at which they first entered homelessness. These findings have implications for policy makers and service providers, as key intervention points are identified.

                    <p>Estimate the frequency of self-reported factual innocence in non-capital cases within a state population of prisoners.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>We conducted a survey of a population sample of state prisoners who were asked to anonymously report their involvement in the crimes for which they were most recently convicted. To assess the validity of verifiable responses, prisoner self-report data were compared to aggregate conviction and demographic information derived from administrative records. To assess the validity of unverifiable responses, we developed a non-parametric test to estimate the probability of false innocence claims.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>We estimate that wrongful convictions occur in 6% of criminal convictions leading to imprisonment in an intake population of state prisoners. This estimate masks a considerable degree of conviction-specific variability ranging from a low of 2% in DUI convictions to a high of 40% in rape convictions. Implausible or false innocence claims are estimated to occur in 2% of cases.</p>

                    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>The present investigation demonstrates that survey methods can provide bounded estimates of factual innocence claims within a discrete and known population. The resulting estimates, the first to formally separate claims of legal and factual innocence and to incorporate a formal measure of response plausibility, suggest that prisoners themselves are very often willing to self-report the correctness of their convictions. At the same time, a considerable minority indicate that procedural weaknesses with the administration of justice occurred in their cases. And, a distinct minority, with considerable offense variation, maintain that they are completely innocent of the charges against them.</p>

                  <span>
                    <h3>Objectives</h3>
                    <p>Our objectives were (1) to systematically map the contours of the European evidence base on labour trafficking, identifying its key characteristics, coverage, gaps, strengths and weaknesses and (2) to synthesise key scientific research.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>We took a two-phase approach: a systematic map followed by a detailed synthesis of key scientific research evidence. Our search strategy included 15 databases, hand searches of additional journals, backwards searches, snowball searches and expert recommendations. We identified and screened 6106 records, mapped 152 and synthesised eight.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>Overall, the literature was limited and fragmented. Reports produced by official agencies dominated; academic authorship and peer-reviewed outputs were comparatively rare. Few publications met minimum scientific standards. Qualitative designs outweighed quantitative ones. Publications typically described trafficking&rsquo;s problem profile and/or discussed interventions; they rarely assessed trafficking&rsquo;s impacts or evaluated interventions. Even among the key scientific research, the quality of evidence was variable and often low. Particular weaknesses included poor methods reporting, unclear or imprecise results and conclusions not properly grounded in the data. The synthesised studies were all exploratory, also sharing other design features. Common themes identified included: poor treatment of victims; diversity of sectors affected and commonalities among victims; inadequacies of current responses; and barriers to interventions.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>There is a lack of high-quality studies into European labour trafficking. Methodological opacity, insufficient rigour and publication in non-indexed locations impede the identification, assessment and synthesis of evidence. Adherence to higher reporting standards would further the field&rsquo;s development and particular research gaps should be addressed.</p>

                  <p>There is no recent national data on the prevalence of intimate partner violence in Thailand. This study proposed to examine the prevalence of intimate partner violence in 4 regions of Thailand by using a standardized questionnaire from the WHO multi country study on women&rsquo;s health and domestic violence. Two thousand four hundred and sixty-two married or cohabiting women aged 20&ndash;59&nbsp;years were interviewed about their experiences of psychologically, physically, sexually violent, and/or controlling behaviors by their male partners<em>.</em> The study found that 15% of respondents had experienced psychological, physical, and/or sexual violence in their life time which suggests that 1 in 6 of Thai women have faced intimate partner violence. Of the 15% of women who reported intimate partner violence within the past 12&nbsp;months, psychological violence was the most common (60&ndash;68%), followed by sexual violence (62&ndash;63%) and physical violence (52&ndash;65%). In addition, the percentage of women who faced various forms of controlling behaviors varied from 4.6% to 29.3%. Men who were more controlling were more likely to abuse their female partners. The results reveal that partner violence against women is a significant public health issue in Thai society that must be addressed.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-9960-9","2018-04-07 08:16:17","51","Journal of Family Violence"

Given the transactional nature of child maltreatment and the difficulties that many maltreating families experience, child protection services typically offer various kinds of programs to maltreated children, their parents, and/or their families. Although the specific difficulties experienced by these families may vary, sub-optimal parenting practices are typically part of the picture and may play a central role in maltreated children&rsquo;s development. Hence, to deal with child maltreatment, programs that focus on parenting practices are essential, and identifying the common components of effective programs is of critical importance. The objectives of the present study were to: 1) describe the components of evidence-based parenting programs aimed at parents who have maltreated their elementary school-aged children or are at-risk for doing so and 2) identify the components that are common to these programs, using the approach proposed by Barth and Liggett-Creel (2014). Fourteen evidence-based parenting programs aimed at parents who had maltreated their elementary school-aged children (ages 6&ndash;12) or were at-risk for doing so were identified using both a review of relevant online databases of evidence-based programs (California Evidence-Based Clearinghouse for Child Welfare, Blueprints for Healthy Youth Development, Youth.gov, and the National Registry of Evidence-based Programs and Practices). Common components were identified (operationalized as components present in two thirds of programs) and discussed.

The purpose of this systematic review is to assess existing empirical evidence evaluating the association between experiences of exclusionary discipline and subsequent justice system involvement. This review is limited to studies using multivariate, inferential statistical techniques. A total of seven studies met specified qualifications and are included in the review.

                  <p>Supervision has been identified within criminology as an important element of crime prevention; however, little is known about the individual factors that explain this behaviour among residential guardians. Unique self-report data on daily surveillance routines of residents were gathered from a national sample of 4824 respondents in the Netherlands to explore the key factors that facilitate and inhibit supervision. It was tentatively estimated that residents carry out supervision roughly a quarter of the time they are at home. Further analyses revealed that individual resident characteristics, such as their perceptions of crime, sense of responsibility for guarding, security training, courageousness and national security values positively predict supervision intensity. Conversely, self-esteem and trust were found to negatively affect supervision. Results suggest that manipulable individual factors such as attitudes are more important at predicting supervision than comparatively static factors such as personality. Implications for criminological theory that explains the concept of supervision as a function of guardianship, and how it can be fostered as a crime control mechanism within residential contexts, will be discussed.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10610-018-9380-7","2018-04-09 10:15:55","32","European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research"

                  <p>This study examined the association between job characteristics, namely job demands and job resources, and mental health outcomes in terms of emotional exhaustion and well-being among police officers. Eight hundred forty-three German police officers participated in a cross-sectional online survey. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the validity of the dual process model of the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) framework in the context of police work. Job demands (verbal assaults by citizens, workload, and administrative stressors) predicted emotional exhaustion whereas job resources (team support, shared values, and perceived fairness) predicted well-being. Moreover, job resources were directly and negatively associated with emotional exhaustion. The findings confirm the capacity of job resources to simultaneously promote well-being and reduce emotional exhaustion. Work place interventions should thus not merely decrease job demands. To improve and protect police officers&rsquo; well-being, it is advisable to promote job resources. A supportive and fair organizational climate based on shared values is required to foster mental health in the context of police work.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9265-1","2018-04-10 04:16:48","48","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"
"10350","Early Adult Offending and Employment Among Serious Adolescent Offenders: An Examination of Adolescent Service Receipt, Attachments, and Perceptions","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Purpose</h3>
                    <p>This study examines whether service experiences, attachments, and perceptions of the legal system are related to early adult outcomes for serious adolescent offenders. This study also examines how individual and social contextual factors are related to previous service experiences among these adolescent offenders.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>Data from the Pathways to Desistance study, a longitudinal study following 1354 serious adolescent offenders from two geographic locations, were used to identify factors related to youth service experiences, and to test whether these service experiences, youth attachments, and youth perceptions were related to adult self-reported offending and employment outcomes.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>Youth from more disadvantaged social contexts were more likely to report previous service receipt at baseline. While group service receipt was related to a higher likelihood of adult offending, residential service receipt was related to a lower likelihood of employment. Youth attachments were positively related to employment in adulthood, whereas youth perceptions (cynicism) were positively related to self-reported offending in adulthood.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>Positive attachments were related to positive adult outcomes (i.e., employment), while negative perceptions were related to negative outcomes (i.e., offending). Serious adolescent offenders have a complex set of needs across social contexts. This may suggest that a holistic approach to studying and serving juvenile delinquents would include a broad range of outcomes, and that effective services should also be complex in addressing not only the individual, but also the challenges within their social contexts.</p>

                  <p>Shoot/no-shoot decisions in law enforcement are under increasing scrutiny nationwide. However, little research has addressed the ways in which factors related to assailants and weapons influence these decisions. In the present research, images of adult male, adult female, and juvenile (female) assailants presented simulated direct threats to respondents. Assailants were armed with a pistol, a knife, or a glass bottle. Respondents were asked to indicate whether or not they would shoot in the presence of these threats. Respondents also completed the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES). Tendencies toward dissociation, a process generating a sense of unreality, influenced the performance of males who shot; more dissociated men took more time to fire. However, dissociation did not influence the performance of women. Sex and youth of the assailant had no effects on the shoot/no-shoot performance of either men or women, and oddly, weapon type had no significant effect on women&rsquo;s performance, although men were more likely to fire on an assailant of either age or sex armed with a gun or knife than a bottle. These results are discussed in terms of relevance for law enforcement training and for juridical proceedings in shoot/no-shoot cases.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9267-z","2018-04-10 20:31:50","73","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"
"10356","Bus Stops and Violence, Are Risky Places Really Risky?","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>Geographic forecasting of crime can be done by considering prior crime or by considering spatial risk factors, e.g., using risk terrain modeling (RTM). The present paper tests both methods, but primarily focuses on RTM and on increasing our understanding of forecasting by attempting to compare the spatial risk factors for where the number of crimes is high with the spatial risk factors for where the risk of victimization is high. This is performed by fitting negative binomial models on crime around bus stops and comparing them to the same models with the number of bus passengers as exposure variable. The models also take the surrounding environment into account by fitting multi-level models with neighborhood level predictors of concentrated disadvantage and collective efficacy. The results show that some types of facilities are risk factors for crime, but not for victimization. This results in new insights into how flows of people impact on forecasting, as for instance a school is a spatial risk factor for crime, while not being associated with an elevated risk per person. The results also show that the neighborhood level of collective efficacy is a stable and significant risk factor both for crime and for risk of victimization, highlighting a potential for better crime forecasting by combining different spatial and theoretical perspectives.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10610-018-9382-5","2018-04-10 22:15:57","207","European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research"
"10357","The Criminal Histories of Drug-Drive Offenders","<span><div>Abstract</div>This study examined the previous criminal behaviour of individuals who were arrested for violating the drug driving over the prescribed limit offence, introduced into the UK in March 2015. The sample consists of individuals arrested during the first year of enforcement of this offence from March 2015 to March 2016 within the jurisdictional boundaries of the Metropolitan Police Service in London. The previous criminal behaviour of the research subjects was framed within a number of criminological theories and there is examination of any correlation between their criminal history and the drug-driving offence they had been arrested for. The criminal activity was obtained from each individual&rsquo;s criminal record held on the police national computer and coded with regards to offence groups. As well as criminal sanctions, there was also an examination of drug-related arrest histories. The results indicate a high level of previous criminal activity with drugs and driving matters dominating that activity. This supports the construct that, in this context, drug driving fits within their patterns of offending.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay026/4967630?rss=1","2018-04-11 06:47:13","48","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"
"10358","Unnecessary Force By Police: Insights From Evolutionary Psychology","<span><div>Abstract</div>The police function in modern society is grounded in the legitimate authority to use force to produce an overall increase in public safety. This authority is granted by a social contract between the police and citizenry, and predicated on the public&rsquo;s faith that the police will not abuse these powers. The police profession is at a critical juncture, due in large part to public concerns about excessive and discriminatory use of force by police. The dual expectations of aggression and restraint must be expertly balanced in policing, but this balance can be challenging given the dangerous realities of, and the increasingly critical atmosphere surrounding, the police profession. In this article, we apply evolutionary psychological theory to understand: (1) why aggression is often a selected response and (2) how restraint may be encouraged in policing contexts. We propose specific recommendations for police training and practice.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay025/4962133?rss=1","2018-04-11 06:47:13","56","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"

                  <span>
                    <h3>Purpose</h3>
                    <p>Using a mediation methodology and three waves of data, the current study sought to determine whether callous-unemotional (CU) traits were capable of suppressing the inhibitory effect of child self-disclosure on delinquency in line with predictions from criminal lifestyle theory. The results were then compared to the suppressant effect of low self-control (LSC) on the child self-disclosure&ndash;delinquency relationship.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>Participants for this study were 2586 (1290 boys, 1296 girls) members of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth&ndash;Child (NLSY-C). CU traits and LSC were measured when participants were 9 to 10&nbsp;years of age, child self-disclosure was measured when participants were 11 to 12&nbsp;years of age, and delinquency was measured when participants were 13 to 14&nbsp;years of age.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>Consistent with predictions, the pathway running from CU traits to child self-disclosure to delinquency was significant whereas the pathway running from LSC to child self-disclosure to delinquency was non-significant. Contrary to predictions, the two pathways were not significantly different from one another.</p>

                    <p>Moderate support was found for the hypothesis that one way CU traits encourage delinquency is by inhibiting the child&rsquo;s willingness to disclose information to parents.

"10369","Employment Discrimination on the Basis of Criminal History: Why An Anti-Discrimination Statute Is A Necessary Remedy","<p>The harms of mass incarceration do not end when an individual is released from prison. Instead, criminal records haunt approximately 70 million people throughout the United States today. Criminal histories follow persons convicted of crimes for the rest of their lives, creating collateral consequences that make it difficult for these individuals to get back on their feet and re-integrate into society. Gaining employment is one of the most crucial steps for returning citizens to take in order to regain stability in their lives. Yet, it remains one of the biggest obstacles. Employers are often wary of hiring persons with criminal records due to fear of liability and the social stigma that frequently attaches to formerly incarcerated individuals. While some remedies exist for returning citizens to clear their record from public view and (in theory) get a clean slate, they are inadequate. This Comment will describe the four most predominant remedies that purport to address the problem of employment discrimination against persons with criminal records: 1) expungement statutes; 2) Fair Credit Reporting Act protections in the context of background checks; 3) Title VII claims; and 4) ban the box provisions. It will then explain how each of these remedies fails to rectify the problem. This Comment argues that an anti-discrimination statute that bans employment discrimination against individuals with criminal records is necessary in order to benefit both the individuals themselves and society as a whole. The conclusion discusses the design of such a statute and ways that legislators should work together to ensure its passage.</p>","https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/jclc/vol108/iss2/5","2018-04-12 02:46:20","28","Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology"
"10370","Kassouf-The Sixth Circuit's Misguided Attempt to Reign in the Irs","<p>The omnibus clause of 26 U.S.C. &sect; 7212(a) is a catch-all provision that broadly punishes people who corruptly endeavor to obstruct administration of the Internal Revenue Code. The Sixth Circuit, in United States v. Kassouf, improperly limited conviction under the omnibus clause to cases where the defendant had knowledge of a pending IRS investigation (a nexus test). The Sixth Circuit is the only circuit today applying this rule, with most others expressly or impliedly rejecting it. Even though the Sixth Circuit is an outlier in applying a nexus test, there has been pervasive discussion of the issue recently. There has been a significant increase in circuit court decisions with some judges and commentators staunchly opposing the majority view. Those in opposition to the majority argue that a nexus test is necessary to limit the IRS from abusing a statute that could expand to criminalizing any wrong act in a tax setting as a felony. Recent claims of the IRS abusing its power lend particular weight to this fear of statutory overreach. In fact, after the original draft of this article was written, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in Marinello v. United States and heard oral argument on this very issue in December 2017. This Comment argues that &sect; 7212(a) is unambiguous and contains no statutory requirement of a nexus test. It recommends how the Supreme Court should resolve the issue, by limiting omnibus clause charges to affirmative acts just as other Title 26 felonies are limited. It further argues why Congress should act expediently to modify &sect; 7212(a). Limiting the omnibus clause beyond its plain meaning is necessary for fair notice and to prevent felony charges for action meant to be punished as a misdemeanor. Congressional action is sorely needed in this area of the law where the stakes are high.</p>","https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/jclc/vol108/iss2/4","2018-04-12 02:46:20","45","Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology"
"10371","The Thin Blue Line From Crime to Punishment","<p>Criminal law scholarship is marked by a sharp fault line separating substantive criminal law from criminal procedure. Philosophical work focuses almost exclusively on the substantive side of that line, addressing adjudicative procedure (the trial process) rarely and investigative procedure (especially police conduct) almost never. Instead, criminal law theorists devote substantial attention to just two questions: what conduct should be criminal, and why is punishment justified? This essay argues that criminal law theory cannot adequately address these favored subjects&mdash;the definition of crime and the justification of punishment&mdash;without also addressing the enforcement mechanisms that link crimes to punishments. Specifically, philosophers of criminal law cannot continue to ignore the police.</p>","https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/jclc/vol108/iss2/3","2018-04-12 02:46:20","61","Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology"
"10372","The Local-Control Model of the Fourth Amendment","<p>Fourth Amendment doctrine has been home to two competing models: the Warrant Model and the Reasonableness Model. The Warrant Model, emphasizing the Amendment&rsquo;s Warrant Clause, holds that search and arrest via warrant is the preferred method and the default rule, though allowing for exceptions when obtaining a warrant is impracticable. The Reasonableness Model, which stresses the Amendment&rsquo;s Reasonableness Clause, holds that the Amendment imposes a generalized reasonableness standard on searches and seizures by which the question is not whether dispensing with a warrant is reasonable but whether the search or seizure itself is reasonable. These polar positions have been replicated in the scholarly literature on the history surrounding the adoption of the Fourth Amendment. Some adhere to a reading of the historical record that roughly supports the Warrant Model while others have found that history more strongly supports the Reasonableness Model. This Article interprets the historical record differently than either of the two dominant schools, and introduces a third model of the Fourth Amendment: the Local-Control Model. It situates the Fourth Amendment as the culmination of a decades-long, continent-wide struggle by Americans for local control over search-and-seizure policy as against central authority. And it posits the Fourth Amendment as the result of an effort on the part of the Anti-Federalists, those who demanded a Bill of Rights, to maintain local control over search-and-seizure policy. On this view, the Fourth Amendment has a strong federalism component. It demands neither that federal officers generally use warrants for searching and seizing nor that they act pursuant to a general reasonableness standard. Rather, the Local-Control Model supports the view that federal officers must generally follow state law in conducting searches and seizures.</p>","https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/jclc/vol108/iss2/2","2018-04-12 02:46:20","33","Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology"
"10373","The Republican Party, Conservatives, and the Future of Capital Punishment","<p>The United States has experienced a significant decline in the death penalty during the first part of the twenty-first century, as death sentences, executions, public support, and states with capital punishment all have declined. Many recent reforms banning or placing a moratorium on executions have occurred in blue states, in line with the notion that ending the death penalty is a progressive cause. Challenging this narrative, however, is the emergence of Republican lawmakers as champions of death penalty repeal legislation in red states. This Article puts these efforts by Republican lawmakers into historical context and explains the conservative case against the death penalty: its incompatibility with limited government, fiscal responsibility, and promoting a culture of life. Understanding Republican opposition to capital punishment takes on particular importance now following setbacks to efforts against the death penalty in the 2016 election. In this environment, building support among Republicans and conservatives likely will prove critical for taking further steps toward limiting and eventually ending the death penalty in the United States.</p>","https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/jclc/vol108/iss2/1","2018-04-12 02:46:20","31","Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology"

Waldron, Angela   Scarpa, Jungmeen   Kim-Spoon<br><abstract-sec ns2=""http://webservices.elsevier.com/schemas/search/fast/types/v4"" soapenv=""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"" view=""all""><simple-para view=""all"">Child maltreatment can have a lasting impact, which is why it is important to understand factors that may exacerbate or mitigate self-esteem difficulties in adulthood. Although there is tremendous benefit that can come from religion and spirituality, few studies examine religious views after child maltreatment. Subsequent interpersonal difficulties may also affect self-esteem in maltreatment survivors. This study sought to examine interpersonal problems and religiosity as mediators in the link between childhood maltreatment and self-esteem in adulthood. The study recruited 718 women (<italic>M</italic>&#8239;=&#8239;19.53 years) from a large public university. Participants completed questionnaires related to child abuse and neglect, interpersonal problems, religiosity, and self-esteem. Results demonstrated that all forms of maltreatment were associated with negative views of God and with more interpersonal difficulties. Viewing God as a punishing figure mediated the relationship between childhood emotional abuse and low adult self-esteem, along with several areas associated with interpersonal problems. Further, for both child emotional neglect and physical abuse, viewing God as less supportive mediated the relationship between child maltreatment and low adult self-esteem. The results may help in intervention for child maltreatment survivors by increasing awareness of the importance of religiosity in treatment to self-esteem issues in both childhood and adulthood.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213418301273%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Dce2a2b6a9d298e568cb89b0c72bb238d","2018-04-12 04:45:19","43","Child Abuse and Neglect"

We explored the everyday symptom profiles and the contexts in which events took place among 100 adolescents over a one-week period. Sociodemographic data were collected and assessment was done using the EMA (as a smartphone application) and the Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire (to assess childhood and adolescent victimization). In this study, regarding contextual variables, the group with the highest level of victimization (top 10%) showed a significant relationship with being away from home and being with friends other than classmates, and not being with parents or relatives. There was also an unexpectedly higher frequency of sporting engagement in this group. A relationship existed between emotional and behavioral problems and higher levels of victimization. In conclusion, the different groups of victimized subjects present a relatively high level of satisfaction in relation to the daily contexts and show low levels of emotional and behavioral symptomatology.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213418301509%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D04b4f370932773065f04bb7a78a9cf8c","2018-04-12 04:45:20","34","Child Abuse and Neglect"
"10376","Data and Evidence Challenges Facing Place-Based Policing","Policing: An International Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose The purpose of this paper is to use an evaluation of a micro-place-based hot-spot policing implementation to highlight the potential issues raised by data quality standards in the recording and measurement of crime data and police officer movements.   Design/methodology/approach The study focusses on an area of London (UK) which used a predictive algorithm to designate micro-place patrol zones for each police shift over a two-month period. Police officer movements are measured using GPS data from officer-worn radios. Descriptive statistics regarding the crime data commonly used to evaluate this type of implementation are presented, and simple analyses are presented to examine the effects of officer patrol duration (dosage) on crime in micro-place hot-spots.   Findings The results suggest that patrols of 10-20 minutes in a given police shift have a significant impact on reducing crime; however, patrols of less than about 10 minutes and more than about 20 minutes are ineffective at deterring crime.   Research limitations/implications Due to the sparseness of officer GPS data, their paths have to be interpolated which could introduce error to the estimated patrol dosages. Similarly, errors and uncertainty in recorded crime data could have substantial impact on the designation of micro-place interventions and evaluations of their effectiveness.   Originality/value This study is one of the first to use officer GPS data to estimate patrol dosage and places particular emphasis on the issue of data quality when evaluating micro-place interventions.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-09-2017-0117?af=R","2018-04-12 09:02:26","403","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

                  <p>Violence against women and violence against children are distinct research fields. Quantitative studies have demonstrated their intersection, but qualitative data provides an opportunity for a comprehensive understanding of this interface. Interviews with 22 parents/caregivers convicted of child homicide provided an opportunity to explore the context of violent experiences in their lives including their use of violence and their experiences of it in their intimate and parenting relationships. Using a feminist framework, we found that patriarchal family structures, gender and power dynamics contribute to the use of violence. Revenge child homicide was common with distinct gendered differences. This study calls for closer collaboration between the two fields to assist in developing prevention interventions to address and eradicate both forms of violence.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-9964-5","2018-04-12 14:16:48","29","Journal of Family Violence"

                  <p>Increasing attention is being paid to suicide among law enforcement officers, and how the agencies that employ these officers could prevent such deaths. This study presents the results of a national survey of U.S. law enforcement agencies&rsquo; strategies for preventing officer suicide. We invited 177 agencies from across the United States to be interviewed, and 110 agreed to participate in qualitative interviews. Agencies were grouped into one of four categories based on the services they offered. Agencies offered minimal (a municipal employee assistance program), basic (mental health, critical incident response procedures, and training), proactive (in-house mental health care, embedded chaplains, substance misuse programs, peer support, screening, or health and wellness programs), and integrated services (integration of services into day-to-day operations). The results indicate that many U.S. law enforcement agencies are engaged in efforts to promote officer wellness and prevent suicide. Officers&rsquo; perceptions of confidentiality may inhibit the use of in-house or contracted mental health services, while a weak or inconclusive evidence-base raises questions about common approaches like peer support or critical incident stress debriefing.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9269-x","2018-04-12 23:17:11","36","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"

                  <span>
                    <h3>Purpose</h3>
                    <p>Marriage provides a source of social control away from crime in adulthood, with considerable empirical support from numerous studies elaborating on marriage within various contexts. The effect was initially identified at a time before the modern rise in divorce rates, the deferring of marriage in favor of less formal relationships like cohabitation, and an overall decline in marriage at all, suggesting the need to examine the effect in the context of changing social customs through time.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>The current study undertook meta-regression analyses to examine the temporal aspects of the marriage effect, and to demonstrate the importance of systematically studying chronological changes over time within the life course perspective.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>While the results do not demonstrate statistically significant temporal changes, the current study expands the discussion of systematically studying chronological change through different methodological strategies.</p>

                  <p>This research focused on the effect of the built environment on Bogot&aacute;&rsquo;s violent crime by using the Risk Terrain Modeling (RTM) technique. The current study used 17 ecological variables, including micro-level data on the spatial distribution of socio-economic strata, and the location of an array of businesses and other features of the landscape. As suggested by the results of this study, the spatial distribution of violent crime in Bogot&aacute; is highly correlated with the allocation of socio-economic strata throughout its geography. A statistically valid RTM analysis identified the micro-level risk factors associated with three types of violent crime incidents, namely homicide, assault, and theft incidents. These results suggest that future violent crime incidents are more likely to occur at a reduced number of high-risk micro-places. Moreover, while homicide and assault incidents were more likely to cluster within the poorest areas of the city, theft incidents presented a higher risk of victimization near the city center, where economic activity and suitable targets concentrate. This study offers a unique account regarding the effect of socio-economic segregation on violent crime victimization across Bogot&aacute;&rsquo;s geography and within different socio-economic strata classifications.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10610-018-9374-5","2018-04-13 11:16:22","42","European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research"

                  <p>Lineup administrators may inadvertently bias an eyewitness&rsquo; identification; as such, the blind-lineup administration is recommended to combat this bias. Three studies examined eyewitness identification accuracy when the lineup is presented on a computer versus in-person to determine whether computer-administrated lineups could replace in-person lineups to ensure blind administration. Study 1 (<em>N</em>&nbsp;=&thinsp;378) varied whether the administration was on a computer versus in-person across the simultaneous, elimination, and wildcard procedures. Overall, participants were more accurate when presented with the online administration; moreover, participants were more accurate in target-absent lineups when presented with a simultaneous or elimination procedure compared to the wildcard procedure. Study 2 (<em>N</em>&nbsp;=&thinsp;367) was similar to study 1 but used different stimuli and included the simultaneous, elimination, and elimination-plus procedures. Identification accuracy was comparable for online and in-person administration. Study 3 (<em>N</em>&nbsp;=&thinsp;219) sought to examine why online administration was superior in study 1 by varying whether the researcher was present only during the identification task. When the researcher was present, participants were more likely to make a foil identification in the simultaneous procedure compared to the elimination procedure. The results of these three studies suggest that computer-administrated lineups may be a feasible solution to ensure blind administration.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9270-4","2018-04-13 13:16:44","35","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"
"10455","Segmentation Analysis of Susceptibility to Cybercrime: Exploring Individual Differences in Information Security Awareness and Personality Factors","<span><div>Abstract</div>The present article aimed to explore if susceptibility to cybercrime can be linked to information security awareness and personality factors. A total of 1,054 participants aged between 18 and 84 years took part in an online survey consisting of a recently developed segmentation analysis tool designed to explore an individual&rsquo;s susceptibility to cybercrime. Alongside this, two other scales measuring information security awareness and the personality trait of impulsivity were also included. In total, 60% of the population surveyed presented as being in the higher risk categories for susceptibility to cybercrime. Furthermore, individuals in the higher risk categories for susceptibility to cybercrime also presented poorer information security awareness, as well as having higher levels of trait impulsivity. It was also noted that certain demographic factors also linked to susceptibility to cybercrime, including age and current employment status, with the unemployed and student populations being less well represented in lower risk categories. This work is seen as being critical while designing effective intervention strategies that are designed to target specific at-risk populations, as well as presenting a key tool that could be widely used by organizations to examine risk within their own specific populations.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay027/4970000?rss=1","2018-04-13 13:47:40","41","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"
"10456","Europolâ€™s Crime Analysis Systemâ€”practical Determinants of Its Success","<span><div>Abstract</div>Threats to modern nation states from organized crime and terrorism create environments in which intelligence becomes a vital component of policing and security plans but the increasing use of personal data for law enforcement purposes can alter the normative relationships between stakeholders and law enforcement agencies and between agencies and citizens. For that reason, police intelligence practice demands critical examination. This paper presents a narrative inquiry, based on the authors&rsquo; experiential knowledge and empirical research, into Europol&rsquo;s Crime Analysis System (ECAS). The study explains Europol&rsquo;s efforts to develop data collection and analysis systems that meet the needs of EU Member States (MS). Through ECAS, it has created powerful tools intended to deliver intelligence products that help MS identify, localize, and neutralize transnational threats to a degree not witnessed before in Europe. Nevertheless, Europol&rsquo;s performance in this context seems sub-optimal. Shortcomings largely are attributed to a lack of trust between Europol and MS leading to failures to share information between themselves and with the institution. The result is that the latter&rsquo;s strategic intelligence products sometimes are deficient or incomplete.

                  <p>&ldquo;The eyes are the window of the soul&rdquo; is a staple clich&eacute; in many cultures, but is there any truth to this concept, of any potential importance in the forensic realm? The present study addressed this question in two experiments. It was shown that observation of the eyes and ocular regions of normal control individuals, and of serial killers, enabled average respondents to distinguish these individuals clearly in terms of trustworthiness, likability, and general &ldquo;goodness.&rdquo; In both experiments, and based on nothing but this observation, serial killers were consistently rated lower on all three indices. No sex or individual differences were observed in this pattern of results. These findings are consistent with current evolutionary and cognitive theory, and may highlight the importance of the perception of defendants by witnesses and jurors in criminal proceedings.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9271-3","2018-04-14 00:16:36","50","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"
"10465","Social Avoidance in Policing","Policing: An International Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the association of social avoidance among police, cardiovascular disease (CVD) (metabolic syndrome (MetSyn)), and social support.   Design/methodology/approach Participants were officers from the Buffalo Cardio-Metabolic Occupational Police Stress study (n=289). Social avoidance (defined as the tendency to avoid social contact) and other subscales from the Cook-Medley Hostility Scale were analyzed. The mean number of MetSyn components across tertiles of the Cook-Medley scales was computed using analysis of variance and analysis of covariance. Social support was measured with the Social Provisions Scale, categorized as high or low based on the median.   Findings The mean number of MetSyn components increased significantly across tertiles of social avoidance (1.51Â±0.18, 1.52Â±0.12, and 1.81Â±0.12); the only Cook-Medley subscale that remained significantly associated with MetSyn following adjustment for age and gender. Participants high in social avoidance reported significantly lower social support (79.9Â±8.5 vs 85.8Â±8.6; p=0.001).   Research limitations/implications The study is cross-sectional and therefore precludes causality. The authors were unable to determine the direction of associations between social avoidance and MetSyn. The measure of social support was unidimensional, including only perceived support; additional types of social support measures would be helpful.   Practical implications This study suggests that occupational-based police social isolation is associated with health outcomes and lower support. Several suggestions are made which will help to improve communication between the police and public. Examples are the use of social media, training in communication techniques, and changing the police role to one of public guardians.   Originality/value Social avoidance is the least studied the Cook-Medley subscale associated with CVD. It is important for the health of officers to maintain a social connection with others.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-02-2017-0017?af=R","2018-04-14 08:32:01","100","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

The research explores victimisation due to the occupational stigma of policing and the personal characteristics and identities of individual officers.   Design/methodology/approach The research design is qualitative, based on 20 in-depth interviews with police officers in one English police force. Thematic analysis was applied to the data.   Findings All participants had experienced hate crime arising from their occupational or personal identities. Initially shocked, officers became desensitized and responded in different ways. These include tolerating and accepting hate crime but also challenging it through communication and the force of law.   Research limitations/implications This research is based on a small sample. It does not claim to be representative but it is exploratory, aiming to stimulate debate and further research on a contemporary policing issue.   Practical implications If further research works were to confirm these findings, there are implications for police training, officer welfare and support, supervision and leadership.   Originality/value The police occupy a problematic position within hate crime literature and UK legislation. This paper opens up debate on an under-researched area and presents the first published study of the hate crime experiences of police officers.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-12-2016-0176?af=R","2018-04-14 08:32:01","76","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

Design/methodology/approach Six years of monthly crime counts for eight violent and property crime types are analyzed. Negative binomial and binary logistic regressions were used to evaluate the impact of the police foot patrol.   Findings The impact of police foot patrol is in a small number of micro-geographic areas. Specifically, only 5 percent of the spatial units of analysis exhibit a statistically significant impact from the foot patrol.   Originality/value These analyses show the importance of undertaking evaluations at the micro-scale in order to identify the impact of police patrol initiative because a small number of places are driving the overall result. Moreover, care must be taken with how small the units of analysis are because as the units of analysis become smaller and smaller, criminal events become rarer and, potentially, identifying statistically significant change becomes more difficult.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-01-2018-0012?af=R","2018-04-14 08:32:01","153","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

We investigated a novel application of Whatman&trade; FTA&trade; Elute cards in their ability to directly amplify PowerPlex&reg; Fusion and Y23 profiles from minute amounts of blood that had been deposited on different concrete structures. In comparison to traditional collection methods, directly profiling blood stained construction materials using FTA&trade; Elute cards increased the percentage loci amplified and significantly improved both allele peak height and peak height ratio while reducing allelic drop-out.

Results showed less intense peaks in the spectra produced by the MCF support (control). Analysis of fingermarks showed ions related to endogenous and exogenous molecular components, including possible lipids from human sebum and quaternary ammonium cations commonly present in cosmetics. Promising and reproducible results were obtained for the fingermarks dusted with the MCF/magnetic powder mixture.

In recent times, gait analysis evidence has emerged as a new area of forensic practice. As its use has continued to spread and develop, the area of work has come under close scrutiny and subsequent criticism. The purpose of this paper is to examine the historical use of gait analysis evidence and consider the criticisms of this work. Through the use of the historical records of cases within the public domain it has been determined that gait analysis as evidence was first presented in court over 175&#8239;years ago, although it has only been utilized by experts in more recent times. The quality of analysis underpinning such evidence has been variable, and has been undertaken by both non-expert and expert witnesses. The work undertaken by expert witnesses appears to have been both non-scientific and scientific in nature, though there is limited reporting of cases involving scientific approaches. Given the variation in the quality of the methodologies utilized, there is the potential for confusion within the courts, where it may be difficult for the judge or jury to determine the appropriate weight that can be attributed to the evidence. It is concluded that future publications should explore the scientific basis of forensic gait analysis to evaluate standards, reliability and validity, as well as reporting the methodologies utilized in relevant cases in the field. It is also recommended that courts consider in greater depth an expert's theoretical approach and experience prior to admitting their evidence. The publication of &lsquo;Forensic gait analysis: a primer for courts&rsquo;, although limited in some aspects of its consideration of practice, is a welcome addition to the information available for guidance.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS1355030617301788%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Dd9a7ddc115b5a294f1a1324ad2a0ce43","2018-04-14 11:32:13","51","Science and Justice"

We outline both linguistic and legal issues which make the evaluation of voice evidence and the refinement of propositions problematic in practice, and illustrate these using case examples. We will argue that group-level observations from the offender sample will always be evidential and that the value of this evidence must be determined by the expert. As such, a proposal is made that experts should, at least conceptually, think of voice evidence as having two levels, both with evidential value: group-level and individual-level. The two rely on different underlying assumptions, and the group-level observations can be used to inform the individual-level propositions. However, for the sake of interpretability, it is probably preferable to present only one combined conclusion to the end user. We also wish to reiterate points made in previous work: in providing conclusions, the forensic expert must acknowledge that the value of the evidence is dependent on a number of assumptions (propositions and background information) and these assumptions must be made clear and explicit to the user.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS1355030618300844%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D4a394461ce3b835002390cf5145f8ee0","2018-04-14 11:32:13","25","Science and Justice"

High quality manufacturing methods further amplify the limitations in detecting variability between samples. Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry (IRMS) has been shown to be a valuable technique in further discriminating plastics. Discrimination is achieved by analysing the relative abundances of stable isotopes within a sample, with differences detected in isotope ratios possibly attributed to the source of raw materials and fractionation during the manufacturing process. A survey of cling wraps and re-sealable zipper storage bags collected in the Australian Capital Territory was undertaken to assess the variability in carbon and hydrogen isotope ratios of different brands and samples.

It was found that the M-Vac&reg; recovered 75% more DNA than double swabbing on bricks. However, double swabbing collected significantly more DNA than the M-Vac&reg; on tiles. Additionally, it was found that cell-free DNA is lost in the filtration step of M-Vac&reg; collection. In terms of peak height and number of true alleles detected, no significant difference was found between the DNA profiles obtained through M-Vac&reg; collection versus double swabbing of tDNA depositions from 12 volunteers on bricks. The results demonstrate that the M-Vac&reg; has potential for DNA collection from porous surfaces such as bricks, but that alterations to the filter apparatus would be beneficial to increase the amount of genetic material collected for subsequent DNA profiling. These results are anticipated to be a starting point to validate the M-Vac&reg; as a DNA collection device, providing an alternative method when DNA is present on a difficult substrate, or if traditional DNA collection methods have failed.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS1355030618300145%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D3badf2c88000ec8e5fc2c81d67e6b043","2018-04-14 11:32:13","42","Science and Justice"

                  <p>This qualitative descriptive study aims to explore (1) the extent of intergenerational continuity of crime in families of organized crime offenders, (2) the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon and (3) the mechanisms underlying intergenerational discontinuity. The study comprised a descriptive analysis of the available numeric information on 25 organized crime offenders based in Amsterdam and their 48 children of at least 19&nbsp;years of age and a more qualitative in-depth analysis of police files, justice department files and child protection service files of all the family members of 14 of the 25 families. Additionally, interviews with employees of the involved organizations were conducted. In terms of prevalence in official record crime statistics, the results show that a large majority of the organized crime offenders&rsquo; sons seem to follow in their fathers&rsquo; footsteps. This is not the case for daughters, as half of them have a criminal record, but primarily for only one minor crime. Intergenerational transmission seems to be facilitated by mediating risk factors, inadequate parenting skills of the mother, the &ldquo;famous&rdquo; or violent reputation of the father, and deviant social learning. If we want to break the intergenerational chain of crime and violence, the results seem to suggest that an accumulation of protective factors seem to be effective, particularly for girls. For girls, supervision from a child protection service also seems to work quite well. For boys, we might need a different approach to prevent them from offending.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10610-018-9381-6","2018-04-14 13:15:56","69","European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research"

Included were comparative studies involving children 11&#8239;years or younger. Quality ranking was based on: confirmation of victim status, consideration of co-perpetration, heterogeneity of the population, and standardization of measurements. Of 13,038 studies reviewed, 33 included studies showed that victimization is associated with negative parenting practices. Based on data presented within individual studies, 21 studies were eligible for meta-analysis which demonstrated modest effect sizes with high levels of heterogeneity.

                  <p>This study explores the utility of a sociological model of social organization developed by Best and Luckenbill (<span>1994</span>) to classify the radicalization processes of terrorists (i.e., extremist perpetrators who engaged in ideologically motivated acts of violence) who are usually categorized as loner or lone wolf attackers. There are several organizational frameworks used to define or classify violent acts performed by individuals who may or may not have ties to extremist groups, but these studies largely ignore the role of social relationships in radicalization and the extent to which they inform our knowledge of terror. To address this gap, we apply the Best and Luckenbill model of social organization using a qualitative analysis of three case studies of four lone actor or small cell terrorists. The findings demonstrate lone actors are not always true loners in the context of radicalization, and highlights the ways that the Internet and social ties foster the radicalization processes of terror.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12103-018-9439-5","2018-04-16 17:45:11","104","American Journal of Criminal Justice"

                  <p>Police shooting decisions have come under increasing scrutiny, and the degree to which potential jurors and witnesses understand those decisions is increasingly important. Officers under the stress of shooting situations may use profanity which may be recorded, but which does not relate to tactical outcomes. This research addressed how such profanity may influence public assessment of police performance. A paragraph was provided to respondents, describing a situation in which a male officer shot an armed adult male perpetrator. The officer was presented as either having used or not used profanity in the situation. Respondents were asked to address the officer&rsquo;s performance under these two different sets of conditions. Profanity resulted in a significantly higher perceived level of officer guilt in these situations, and a diminished perception of his professionalism, but did not result in a lower level of perception as to whether the officer had successfully resolved the situation or had done the &ldquo;right thing.&rdquo; Results are discussed in terms of current cognitive theory and of practical application in the field and in court.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9268-y","2018-04-17 00:16:39","76","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"

Design/methodology/approach Data from interviews of 32 offenders and 29 family members are examined qualitatively for themes to evaluate how the strategy was carried out and how it impacted offendersâ€™ behavior and both groupsâ€™ perceptions of the police detectives and the strategy overall.   Findings The results show that there was overwhelming agreement by both offenders and their family members that the police detectives who contacted them treated both groups with dignity and respect. After the contact was over, the offenders appeared to commit less crime, followed probation more closely, and had positive feelings about what the police detectives were trying to do. Improvement of the offendersâ€™ relationships with their families was an unanticipated finding indicating a diffusion of benefits of the strategy.   Practical implications The results suggest that when procedural justice principles are used in an offender-focused police intervention, positive impact can be achieved without negative consequences.

"10509","Institutionalizing Place-Based Policing: the Adoption of A Case of Place Approach","Policing: An International Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose Research shows that crime and disorder tend to concentrate in small, geographic locations and that place-based and problem-solving policing strategies can impact crime and disorder without displacing it to neighboring areas. However, implementation of problem-solving is a challenge. Loosely defined locations, shallow problem analysis, and distractions to problem-solving are cited implementation shortcomings. These shortcomings may be overcome by using the Case of Place approach, a case management strategy focused on documenting and analyzing place-based dynamics and characteristics to inform and direct policing strategies. The paper aims to discuss these issues.   Design/methodology/approach The current study describes the adoption of the Case of Place approach in an urban police agencyâ€™s operations and performance management system. The authors utilize implementation theory to explore and explain the adoption of this new place-based strategy.   Findings Key findings reveal important structural and cultural challenges to implementation. Structural challenges included modifying supervision structures, creating new positions, decentralizing analytical functions, and redirecting resources to problem-solving. Cultural challenges observed included emphasizing problem-solving as an organizational priority, integrating crime analysts into neighborhood precincts, and centering performance management processes around problem-solving.   Originality/value The authors explore how implementation dynamics impact the adoption of new policies and practices, and offer a number of propositions for the use of the Case of Place approach within a place-based strategy portfolio.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-09-2017-0119?af=R","2018-04-18 08:17:18","52","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

                  <p>Much offending, particularly acts of acquisitive crime, is influenced by whether there is a discernible opportunity to take advantage of. The success of this can be determined by the presence or absence of certain characteristics in the immediate environment and how they are interpreted to facilitate gain by an offender. This study explores some of these techniques or &lsquo;affordances&rsquo; that have been adopted by individuals when seeking to commit Theft from a motor vehicle offences.

An Analysis of Economies of Scale and Market Power in Police Departments","Policing: An International Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether the nature of policing services allows for economies of scale to be realized. It is also a replication of Southwick (2005).   Design/methodology/approach This study replicates the methodology used by Southwick (2005) to estimate police production and demand in order to determine whether there are economies of scale among police departments in a western state. Southwickâ€™s (2005) method is unique in that it incorporates measures of market power to predict police efficiency. The present study is unique in that it involves data from a low-density, low-population western state.   Findings Southwickâ€™s results for New York State are markedly different from the results found for Idaho, thus questioning the external validity of Southwickâ€™s model as applied to a relatively low-population state. The findings also indicate that, controlling for relevant variables, crime in Idaho is highly correlated with population, suggesting that police departments in low density/population states would not achieve efficiency gains through consolidation.   Research limitations/implications The implications of this study include validating police performance measures and evaluating applicability of market power to police departments.   Practical implications No evidence was found to support the contention that consolidation of police departments results in efficiency gains.   Originality/value This is the first study of economies of scale in policing to use data from a low-density, low-population western state.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-08-2016-0135?af=R","2018-04-19 08:32:31","66","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

Design/methodology/approach A sample of 1,197 residents from a mid-size California city was surveyed. Regression analyses were conducted to examine the relative effects of media consumption and personal experience on perceptions of police legitimacy.   Findings Partial support for the cultivation theory was found. Those who reported local TV as their most important news source saw police as more legitimate than those who reported the internet as most important. Consistent with past research, procedural justice was the strongest predictor of perceptions of police legitimacy for those recently stopped by the police. Awareness of negative media depictions of police, however, also had independent effects indicating that media consumption does impact perceptions of police legitimacy.   Originality/value While a wealth of research on the relationship between procedural justice and perceptions of police legitimacy exists, no previous research has examined the role media consumption plays in shaping such perceptions.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-12-2016-0177?af=R","2018-04-19 08:32:31","116","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

While there is no evidence to suggest that online abuse and exploitation is a more serious offence than crimes occurring offline, the behaviours enabled by social media may present a significant risk factor for some children. This article gives a brief overview of the phenomena and prevalence of online child sexual abuse and exploitation and the role that the Internet may play. This is considered in relation to deterrence, prevention and management of these crimes, and further develops a public health approach to online child abuse and exploitation. Finally, the article critically considers emerging evidence to support this interaction between the individual and the online environment.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay028/4976527?rss=1","2018-04-19 08:47:44","130","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"

However, much of this research has focused on personality at a higher-order level, such as the domain level within the Five Factor Model (FFM). The present meta-analysis specifically focused on the lower-order facet scales of the FFM (as measured by the NEO-PI-R and IPIP-NEO) which have been shown to add important predictive utility above the domains. Expanding on previous work, the current study examined the relations between the FFM facets and a variety of antisocial behaviors including physical aggression, relational aggression, reactive aggression, proactive aggression, and non-violent antisocial behavior. Meta-analytic results show that a subset of FFM facets, primarily those related to antagonistic and disinhibited behavior, showed the most consistent relations with antisocial behaviors. However, effect size magnitudes were influenced by what type of antisocial behavior was examined. The results are discussed within the broader context of research on personality and antisocial behavior, etiological models of aggressive behavior, and the degree to which the results match the trait profiles of constructs with robust links to antisocial behavior (i.e., psychopathy).</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0047235218301259%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D40c36cc8e8f932c73e73a18a14448099","2018-04-19 23:01:31","50","Journal of Criminal Justice"

                  <p>Psychological distress and alcohol abuse have been linked to intimate partner violence (IPV). However, not all victims develop these problems. This study analyses the impact of IPV severity, social support, and self-esteem on depressive and anxiety symptoms as well as on alcohol abuse, and tests social and personal resources as moderators of the abuse-psychological distress-substance abuse link in a sample of Portuguese women including victims and non-victims of IPV (<em>N</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;209). IPV severity contributed significantly to depression and anxiety symptoms as well as to alcohol abuse, after controlling for socio-demographic factors. Both social support and self-esteem were found to moderate the relation between IPV and depression and anxiety symptoms. However, moderation did not occur for the association between IPV and alcohol abuse. This study shows the impact of IPV on mental health and on alcohol abuse, and highlights the need to design effective interventions that promote social and personal resources in victimized women.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-9962-7","2018-04-20 12:01:35","28","Journal of Family Violence"
"10539","Predicting Job Satisfaction and Motivation of Aviation Security Personnel: A Test of Job Characteristics Theory","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>The subject of job satisfaction and motivation of personnel employed in law enforcement and order maintenance has received some attention from researchers in recent years. Despite the transformation experienced in the area of airport security post-9/11 terrorist attacks, our understanding about job satisfaction and motivation as it relates to airport police officers engaged in aviation security is limited. The aim of this article is to explore our understanding of police officers assigned to aviation security by examining factors that influence their motivation and job satisfaction. We employed Hackman and Oldham&rsquo;s (Org Behav Hum Perform 16(2):250&ndash;279, <span>1976</span>, Work redesign, Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA, <span>1980</span>) job characteristics model to examine the predictors of job satisfaction and motivation in this context. Our findings from a survey of 637 airport police officers in Turkey suggest that while rewards and autonomy influence officers&rsquo; job satisfaction, autonomy, task significance, and feedback clearly affect motivation. The overall findings offer important insights and implications, both theoretically and practically, to the field of aviation security and policing, suggesting a practical framework for managers to enhance officers&rsquo; motivation and job satisfaction more generally.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1057/s41284-018-0137-2","2018-04-20 12:02:39","32","Security Journal"

"10543","Can Higher Education Reduce the Negative Consequences of Police Occupational Culture Amongst New Recruits?","Policing: An International Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose There is considerable evidence to illustrate police occupational culture can negatively influence service delivery and organizational reform. To counteract this, and to improve professionalism, the police services of England and Wales will become a graduate profession from 2020, although little empirical evidence exists as to what impact this will have. The purpose of this paper is to examine the implications of a police degree course on its students.   Design/methodology/approach Initially, a survey was conducted with 383 university students studying for criminal justice-related undergraduate degrees in a UK university. This indicated Police Foundation degree students (n=84), identified themselves as being different, and behaving differently, to other university students. To explore the reasons for this, four focus groups were conducted with this cohort, during their two-year degree programme.   Findings The study found that the Police Foundation degree students quickly assimilated a police identity, which affected their attitudes and behavior. The process led to a strengthening of ties within their own student group, at the expense of wider student socialization.   Originality/value The study provides new findings in relation to undergraduate students who undertake a university-based degree programme, tailored to a future police career. The results have implications for both police policy makers and those in higher education as it highlights the strength of police occupational culture and the implications for the design of future police-related degree programmes.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-10-2016-0154?af=R","2018-04-21 08:17:19","63","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"
"10544","Shaping the Police Workforce: A State-of-the-Art Literature Review","Policing: An International Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose The purpose of this paper is to review the evidence about the factors shaping the police workforce, commissioned by the Scottish Police Authority and Scottish Institute for Policing Research.   Design/methodology/approach The paper uses the theory of strategic fit to assess the available evidence relating to reshaping the police workforce and brings together the most relevant recent reviews of police organisations and empirical studies on these issues. The use of the theory enabled the strategies that have been adopted by police agencies in recent years to be evaluated in relation to the current political and economic environment.   Findings The authors find that here is considerable uncertainty and while there has been previous discussion on the benefits of larger or smaller forces there is not robust evidence that a particular force size is optimal for either efficacy or efficiency, although very small forces may struggle in some ways. There is also mixed evidence about whether increasing police organisation resourcing to allow more officers to be employed reduces crime levels, and there is a relative lack of evidence about the impact this has on the other areas of community life in which police are involved.   Research limitations/implications There are major weaknesses in research relating to police organisational reform: there is no accepted theory of police reform, no accepted method as to how such a reform should be evaluated nor have there been any comparative studies of earlier police civilianisation programs (Braithwaite, Westbrook and Ledema, 2005).   Originality/value Previous work on this topic often focuses on which organisational structure â€“ whether in terms of workforce mix or size â€“ is most efficient or effective. This research takes an alternative perspective and argues for a shift in the research agenda to take account of the friction involved in processes of organisational change, both in order to build a stronger research understanding of these important aspects of change and to more effectively inform policy. The paper provides a basis for the development of theories for understanding police reform in general â€“ and workforce restructuring in particular â€“ alongside appropriate methods for researching it.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-11-2017-0135?af=R","2018-04-21 08:17:20","97","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"
"10545","Analyzing Racial Profiling From Traffic Searches","Policing: An International Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the issue of racial profiling when the traffic stop outcome is a search using focal concerns theory as a theoretical explanation for police officer decision making and propensity score matching (PSM) as a better analysis to understand the race of the driver.   Design/methodology/approach The data for this study come from traffic stops conducted by the Louisville Police Department between January 1 and December 31, 2002.   Findings The results show that the elements of focal concerns theory matter most when it comes to if a traffic stop that resulted in a search even though racial profiling was evident. The use of PSM provides evidence that it is a better statistical technique when studying racial profiling. The gender of the driver was significant for male drivers but not for female drivers.   Research limitations/implications The data for this study are cross-sectional and are self-report data from the police officer.   Practical implications This paper serves as a theoretical explanation that other researchers could use when studying racial profiling along with a better type of statistical analysis being PSM.

"10546","Police Cynicism in Serbia: Prevalence, Nature and Associations With Job Satisfaction","Policing: An International Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present the results of the first research on prevalence, nature and correlates of the police cynicism in Serbia, with particular attention to the associations of cynicism with job satisfaction.   Design/methodology/approach Data were collected using a paper-based survey, and obtained from 472 police officers from five police departments across the country. For the purpose of measuring of organizational and work aspects of police cynicism a new developed 24 five-level Likert-type items scale was used.   Findings The results show that cynicism is normally distributed. No statistically significant gender, education or police rank differences were identified, and the length of service does not appear to influence cynical attitudes significantly. Cynicism scores statistically significantly varied across police departments and predicted job dissatisfaction. The underlying four-factor structure of police cynicism was identified. The factors include: general organizational cynicism; cynicism toward police hierarchy/superiors; cynicism toward public/citizen cooperation; and cynicism toward modernization of policing in the crime control field.   Research limitations/implications The generalizability of the sample is limited, giving that participants come from only five out of a total of 27 police departments in the country, while the female police officers and officers with education higher than high school were somewhat overrepresented.   Originality/value This research provides some more evidence on the nature and determinants of police cynicism that might inspire future research in this important but under-researched area. It implies that the need to explore more deeply relations between police cynicism and stress, burnout and particularly contextual and departmental factors that might be influential to police cynicism. It might also incite future research on the internal structure of police cynicism.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-09-2016-0147?af=R","2018-04-21 08:17:20","37","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"
"10547","The Asymmetric Effect of Bankruptcy Fraud in Sweden: A Long-Term Perspective","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Objectives</h3>
                    <p>The knowledge of the effects of white-collar crimes is incomplete. In the article, we operationalize white-collar crimes as bankruptcy frauds. Economic models maintain that interlinkages between firms may give &lsquo;domino effects&rsquo;: bankruptcy events could lead to &lsquo;bankruptcy chains&rsquo; in which a bankruptcy spreads to other firms. Analogously, criminologists assert that social and economic networks can be a major source of fraud diffusion, with the potential to drive other firms bankrupt. Recent empirical results show that crimes may have detrimental and even asymmetric (nonlinear) effects on economic activity. We analyze the diffusion and the aggregate development of bankruptcy frauds in Sweden over nearly two hundred years, specifically focusing on the relationship between bankruptcy frauds and the bankruptcy volume. We also consider linkages between bankruptcy frauds, bankruptcies, and the macroeconomic cycle.</p>

                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>We use long, aggregate time series, collected from several different historical and contemporary sources. Applying the recently developed cointegrating nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) model, we investigate whether the bankruptcy volume reacts asymmetrically to increases and decreases in bankruptcy frauds, both in the short and the long run.</p>

                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>Bankruptcy frauds reveal a causal effect on bankruptcies, showing an asymmetric (nonlinear) diffusion effect from economic frauds to the bankruptcy volume. Increases in bankruptcy frauds have a positive and significant effect on the bankruptcy volume. However, decreases in bankruptcy frauds show no significant effect. No causal relationship between the macroeconomic cycle and bankruptcy frauds is found.</p>

                    <p>Our data and research approach demonstrate how previously generated hypotheses in both criminology and economic research on the relationship between (economic) crimes, economic activity, and the diffusion of white-collar crime can be tested at an aggregate level.</p>

                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>A mixed-methods, block randomized controlled trial was conducted. Baseline and exit surveys were conducted to evaluate device usage, application usage, knowledge of crime clusters, and data sources that individuals perceived to be most useful in identifying crime clusters.

                    <p>The results of this research suggest that patrol officers did not value the functionality offered by mobile crime mapping capabilities. Despite broad popularity of agency-provided smartphones, users saw little value in the custom app developed for those devices. Users reported that they were already aware of where crime was occurring and that the mobile platform did not provide useful additional details. Focus group members described some backfire effects of the evaluation methodology.</p>

                    <p>The results of this randomized experiment demonstrate that smartphone-based crime mapping technology was poorly adopted because it was not perceived as useful. These results suggest that decentralizing crime mapping to this degree may have limited utility for end users. However, advances in smartphone technology since this research was conducted may provide future opportunities for development.</p>

A largely distinct literature has highlighted the criminogenic influence of the built environment. Recent research cross-pollinated these literatures and demonstrated that, controlling for structural socioeconomic disadvantage, an aggregated neighborhood risk of crime (ANROC) measure capturing the influence of the built environment has a strong and robust influence on neighborhood crime rates. Instead of viewing variation in crime as a product of social factors or characteristics of the built environment, the current study advances the literature by exploring an interactive model viewing crime as a product of social factors and the built environment. Conceptually, we describe two distinct processes (attenuation and amplification) by which social structural sources of violence and characteristics of the environmental backcloth may interact. In assessing the salience of these processes, the current study provides a more accurate assessment of how divergent ecological contexts work contemporaneously to influence neighborhood levels of crime. Results of our block-group level analyses of a single city indicate structural disadvantage is an exceptionally robust predictor of crime, but the influence of the ANROC measure is contingent upon levels of socioeconomic disadvantage in the neighborhood at-large.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0047235218300552%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D770a12ae79c6ea1cf90e57e90635f946","2018-04-21 23:16:36","89","Journal of Criminal Justice"

                  <p>This article highlights the social, cultural, and political landscape in which organized hate groups emerge, drawing from a 3-year study of the right-wing extremist movement in Canada. Through extensive interviews with law enforcement, community activists and hate group activists, as well as open source intelligence, we examined the factors that are associated with the emergence of right-wing extremist groups and right-wing inspired violence in Canada in the early to mid 2010s. Here, our focus is on the social contexts that enable such groups to flourish. We first lay out the theoretical frame to understand how broader social, cultural and political patterns render &ldquo;permission to hate&rdquo;. We consider the environmental factors that we identified, during our fieldwork, as particularly important in facilitating right-wing extremism.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10612-018-9394-y","2018-04-23 16:16:01","90","Critical Criminology"

Recent research shows that while usually half of all criminal events are concentrated in about 3 percent of places commonly referred to as â€œhotspotsâ€ of crime, similar proportions of harm concentrate in only 1 percent of places. These are â€œharmspots.â€ Identifying that harm is a more concentrated issue suggests wide policy and research implications, but what are the dynamics of these harmspots? The paper aims to discuss this issue.   Design/methodology/approach This paper provides a descriptive framework for measuring, as well as evidence about, these patterns and concentrations, harmspots in Sussex, England.   Findings There are four discrete offense categories that account for 80 percent of all the harm within harmspots. These categories include: sexual offenses, violence against the person, robbery and theft. Within these high harmspots, crime counts and harm are strongly correlated (r=0.82, p=0.001). Temporal analyses show that harmspots are not evenly spread across time and place, with night time and weekends becoming substantially more susceptible to harm â€“ more than count-based models. Harmspot trajectory analysis suggests evidence of stability over time within the high harmspots; most harmspots remain chronically inflicted with harm. Violence and sexual offenses are random in their spatial distribution between the harmspots, but robberies and theft are more closely coupled to particular harmspots than others.   Originality/value Implications of these findings are discussed in terms of future research avenues and crime policy.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-03-2017-0041?af=R","2018-04-24 08:32:38","92","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

                  <p>In this paper, it is argued that the psychological contract (PC) could provide rich insights into the understanding of employee and employer relations within the police and the stress and wellbeing of officers. Eighteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with active, full-time police officers and these were analysed using framework analysis. More than 100 base-units of meaning were identified which were categorised into six main themes namely &lsquo;Motivation&rsquo;, &lsquo;Mutual obligations&rsquo;, &lsquo;Stressors&rsquo;, &lsquo;Negative consequences&rsquo;, &lsquo;Mediators&rsquo; and &lsquo;Positive impact of the job&rsquo;. From the interviews, it was apparent that some officers are experiencing PC breach and that this was having a negative impact on their wellbeing.

All Jewish religious groups reported equivalent levels of sexual abuse, except that history of involuntary penetration was greater among formerly (but not presently) Orthodox Jews (<italic>OR</italic>&#8239;=&#8239;3.00). Across our sample, sexual abuse was associated with increased likelihood of psychiatric diagnosis (<italic>OR</italic>&#8239;=&#8239;1.34), greater mental distress (<italic>F</italic> ranging from 2.99 to 9.08, <italic>p</italic>&#8239;&amp;lt;&#8239;.05 for all analyses), lower religious observance (<italic>F</italic>&#8239;=&#8239;4.53, <italic>p</italic>&#8239;=&#8239;.03), and lower intrinsic religiosity (<italic>F</italic>&#8239;=&#8239;4.85, <italic>p</italic>&#8239;=&#8239;.03). Further, across our sample we observed a moderate buffering effect of spiritual/religious factors against mental distress (&Delta;<italic>R<sup loc=""post"">2</sup></italic> values ranging from 0.028 to 0.045, <italic>p</italic> &amp;lt;.01 for all analyses). Thus, we found childhood sexual abuse to occur across the spectrum of Jewish religious affiliation and greater prevalence among formerly Orthodox individuals. Furthermore, history of childhood sexual abuse was associated with greater risk for psychiatric distress and less religious involvement, however spiritual/religious engagement and belief appeared to facilitate resilience in the context of abuse.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213418301625%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Da5513ff00e790fc7417b0c032a2fa2ef","2018-04-24 22:15:22","56","Child Abuse and Neglect"

Yet, how maltreatment types independently and jointly influence the risk for psychiatric problems remains unclear. The aim of the study was two-fold: first, to replicate recent findings regarding the impact of maltreatment types on youth psychiatric symptoms, based on a Brazilian sample of high-risk adolescents (n&#8239;=&#8239;347; age range&#8239;=&#8239;11&ndash;17&#8239;yrs), and second, to extend existing findings by examining whether this relationship is mediated by bullying victimization and/or perpetration. Measures included self-report ratings of childhood maltreatment and peer victimization, as well as multi-informant reports of internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Consistent with prior research, we found that: (i) maltreatment types often co-occurred; (ii) there was a linear association between number of maltreatment types experienced and symptom severity (i.e. cumulative effect); and (iii) emotional abuse emerged as the most consistent independent predictor of poor mental health across domains, raters, and gender. Additionally, this study extends previous findings by showing that the influence of maltreatment on psychiatric outcomes is partially mediated by peer victimization, but not by bullying perpetration. In conclusion, these findings expand our understanding of the heterogeneity in individual responses to maltreatment as well as highlighting emotional abuse as an important predictor of poor mental health.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS014521341830125X%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D1dffc492b510df707d15469d015d7cab","2018-04-24 22:15:22","47","Child Abuse and Neglect"

Research investigating the negative impacts of child maltreatment and other traumas has typically examined these experiences individually, controlling for co-occurring traumas, or has combined these experiences into a general variable of risk, thereby obscuring the complex relationships among environmental traumas and maltreatment. The current study expands on previous research by elucidating relationships between multiple contexts of overlapping traumas and maltreatment experienced by children, and by categorizing how these experiences join together to impact internalizing and externalizing symptomatology. Participants included 316 maltreated children and 269 nonmaltreated children (<italic>M</italic> age&#8239;=&#8239;9.4, <italic>SD</italic>&#8239;=&#8239;0.88) who attended a summer day camp research program for low-income children. Latent Class Analysis (LCA) identified three differential patterns of trauma exposure across children: 1) community violence and loss; 2) pervasive trauma; and 3) low trauma. Covariate analyses demonstrated that child maltreatment was significantly associated with class membership, suggesting that maltreated children were more likely to experience diverse traumas extending beyond their maltreatment experiences (pervasive trauma class). A two-way analysis of variance also demonstrated that trauma latent class membership and child maltreatment each represented unique predictors of internalizing and externalizing symptoms, with each having an independent effect on symptomatology. This investigation provides unique insight into the differential impact of patterns of trauma exposure and child maltreatment, providing support for further research and clinical practice addressing multiple levels of a child&rsquo;s ecology.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS014521341830156X%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D0ad435a198bec8746408b37e6299d759","2018-04-24 22:15:23","43","Child Abuse and Neglect"

                  <p>Gender-based fatal violence (femicide) is a preventable cause of premature death. The Counting Dead Women Australia (CDWA) campaign is a femicide census counting violent deaths of women in Australia from 2014. We conducted a cross-sectional in-depth review of CDWA cases Jan-Dec 2014 to establish evidence of antecedent factors and describe femicide in Australia. Victim (<em>n</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;81) and perpetrator (<em>n</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;83) data were extracted from the CDWA register, law databases and coronial reports. Mixed methods triangulation of socio-demographic and incident characteristics. Women ranged in age from 20 to 82&nbsp;years of age (44&thinsp;&plusmn;&thinsp;15.4). There were 83 perpetrators, of which 13 were unknown (not yet apprehended). Known perpetrators (<em>n</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;70) ranged in age from 16 to 72&nbsp;years of age (40&thinsp;&plusmn;&thinsp;12.7) and 89% were male (62/70). The location of the crime was most frequently the victim&rsquo;s home (49/70). In cases where the relationship between the victim and perpetrator was known (<em>n</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;59), over half of femicides were committed by intimate-partners (33/59). Intimate-partner perpetrators were more likely to have a history of violence and commit murder-suicide than other perpetrators. Femicide is overwhelmingly perpetrated by males, with women most vulnerable in their own home and with their intimate partners. Furthermore, intimate-partner femicide is associated with modifiable risk factors, including previous violence and mental health issues, which represents opportunities for early intervention within healthcare settings as practitioners are well-placed to identify risk and provide support. In line with recommendations for multi-sectoral approach, future research should target identification of risk and protective factors, and improved coordination of data collection.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-9963-6","2018-04-27 03:16:17","72","Journal of Family Violence"

                  <p>In recent years, increasing attention has been paid to police officers&rsquo; organisational commitment. This research paper contributes to this growing body of knowledge by investigating commitment amongst recent police recruits. The paper examines the extent to which new recruits&rsquo; existing knowledge of the police service prior to becoming an officer predicts organisational commitment, and different possible sources of this pre-entry knowledge. Using a sample of 236 recent police recruits in England and Wales, the study observed a significant relationship between recent recruits&rsquo; existing knowledge of the police service and their organisational commitment. Prior police work experience (both paid and voluntary) significantly predicted existing knowledge of the police service, and in turn organisational commitment. In comparison, pre-entry police training did not predict existing knowledge of the police service, and moreover was found to negatively predict organisational commitment. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to proposed changes to recruitment and entry routes into policing in England and Wales.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9273-1","2018-04-27 13:31:50","45","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"

                  <p>Women-only parks (WOPs) are gender-exclusive spaces. In the Indian subcontinent, they have been a social norm&nbsp;for centuries, and they are widespread today. This article aims to investigate the nature of WOPs in Karachi, Pakistan, by (a) inspecting and assessing the environment of these parks based on crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED) principles, (b) evaluating users&rsquo; and nonusers&rsquo; perceptions of safety, and (c) assessing how the environment of WOPs, inspected based on CPTED principles, relates to women&rsquo;s perceptions. Field observations, a questionnaire survey, and interviews underpin the methodology. Results indicate that most users of WOPs feel safe there, but no significant differences exist between users&rsquo; and nonusers&rsquo; views of safety in public spaces in Karachi. Typical CPTED features (e.g., locks and gatekeepers) in WOPs seem to have a positive influence on park users&rsquo; perception of safety. The article concludes with a discussion of the results and implications for future research.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1057/s41284-018-0138-1","2018-04-27 15:33:14","62","Security Journal"

The study sample included 491 adolescents who were between 11 and 13 years of age at baseline. Higher levels of initial PTS symptoms were associated with higher levels of externalizing behavior problems, but the rate of change in PTS symptoms were not significantly associated with the rate of change in externalizing behavior problems over time. Although physical abuse was concurrently associated with both externalizing behavior problems and PTS symptoms at all assessment points, there were no lagged effects. Additionally, we found that physical abuse indirectly affects subsequent development of externalizing behavior problems and PTS symptoms through ongoing physical abuse. Findings highlight the comorbidity of externalizing behaviors and PTS symptoms among early adolescents in the child welfare system, underlining the importance of screening for and addressing these problems simultaneously.

"10599","Police Management Reform, Labor Productivity, and Citizensâ€™ Evaluation of Police Services","Policing: An International Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose This study tracks changes in labor productivity of the Finnish police force over a period of thorough management reforms (2009-2014). Theoretically, the study is based on the cost disease hypothesis. It was assumed that police management reforms have had no noticeable effect on labor productivity and that, therefore, the fact that both physical police facilities and frontline employees have been reduced during the reform years has been reflected on the output side: on the number of outputs, accessibility, and quality of police services. The paper aims to discuss this issue.   Design/methodology/approach The study was conducted as a series of longitudinal function-specific output-input analyses (2000-2015). The project employed data from the Police Performance Management database, Police Citizen Surveys (PCSs, 1999-2016), and Police Personnel Surveys (1999-2015). Methodologically, it relied on two different compounded annual growth rate concepts, linear regressions and likelihood ratio analyses.   Findings The rate of growth of labor productivity was unaffected by the management reform period. In fact, productivity may have declined during the reform process. Citizensâ€™ evaluations of police services have slightly deteriorated over the management reform period.   Research limitations/implications PCS data are based on quota sampling. The procedure contains random sampling elements but is not fully random. The earliest PCS data lack satisfactory population weights, which is why unweighted data had to be used in this study.   Originality/value Longitudinal studies on police productivity and, relatedly, on the cost disease phenomenon are rare. Yet, the themata are potentially very significant for both citizens and policy makers.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-02-2017-0025?af=R","2018-04-28 08:31:53","47","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

Design/methodology/approach Using several databases, a literature search was performed to collect the available empirical studies on the topic.   Findings An analysis of the extant literature suggests that neighborhood/ecological influence on police use of force might not be as uniform as previously discussed, and it suffers from the ability to make sufficient comparisons. Tests vary based on the use of force measures, units of analysis, and the neighborhood-level variables examined.   Originality/value This review should serve as a point of departure for scholars working in this area moving forward. It is hoped that the review provides thought-provoking commentary on the limitations of previous studies and the challenges facing this line of inquiry in the future.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-07-2017-0087?af=R","2018-04-28 08:31:53","98","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

"10602","Mental Toughness and Perceived Stress in Police and Fire Officers","Policing: An International Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose Mental toughness describes a set of attributes relating to how individuals deal with challenges, stressors, and pressure. The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationships between mental toughness and perceived stress in police and fire officers.   Design/methodology/approach The participants were 247 police officers and 130 fire fighters. Participants completed questionnaire measures of mental toughness and perceived stress, and provided information about their age, rank, and length of service within the force.   Findings Mental toughness was found to be significantly related to perceived stress, with control of emotion, control of life, and confidence in abilities being particularly important. There was no consistent relationship of age, rank, or length of service with mental toughness and perceived stress. However, police officers reported lower levels of mental toughness and higher levels of perceived stress than fire officers.   Practical implications The results suggest that assessing police and fire officers on a measure of mental toughness could provide a means of identifying individuals more likely to suffer from stress and stress-related physical and psychological illness. In addition, interventions that may enhance mental toughness could have beneficial effects within this population.   Originality/value This is the first study to examine mental toughness and perceived stress within this population, and the findings have important implications for the management of stress.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-01-2017-0013?af=R","2018-04-28 08:31:53","82","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"
"10603","Sex Differences in Posttraumatic Stress and Depressive Symptoms in Police Officers Following Exposure to Violence in Ferguson","Policing: An International Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose Women comprise a significant and growing proportion of the law enforcement population. Despite this, their potentially unique reactions to job-related posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and depression have been underrepresented in the relevant literature, particularly within the context of exposure to community violence. Also understudied is the role of empathy in the development of post-trauma reactions, which has been a risk factor for the development of posttraumatic distress in previous studies. With the recent endorsement of empathy training by the Presidentâ€™s Task Force on 21st Century Policing, it is important to examine ways in which empathy may contribute to differences in PTSS and depression for male and female officers. The paper aims to discuss this issue.   Design/methodology/approach Male and female police officers (n=189) exposed to violence during the 2014 Ferguson protests completed a battery of measures designed to assess demographic information, prior trauma history, and mental health outcomes.   Findings Moderation analyses showed that empathy moderated the relationships between exposure and PTSS and exposure and depression in female officers, such that exposure was associated with higher posttraumatic stress and depressive symptoms only for female officers with high levels of empathy. These relationships were not found for men.   Originality/value This study is the first to examine sex differences and the role of empathy in the mental health effects of law enforcement secondary to violence during community protests against policing.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-01-2017-0007?af=R","2018-04-28 08:31:53","47","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"
"10604","Measurement Issues in Police Use of Force: A State-of-the-Art Review","Policing: An International Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose The purpose of this paper is to systematically and comprehensively review the extant literature on measurement issues in police use of force.   Design/methodology/approach The current study uses a narrative meta-review of measurement issues in police use of force through a systematic and exhaustive search of several academic databases (e.g. Criminal Justice Abstracts, EBSCO Host, PsychInfo, etc.).   Findings The current meta-review identified 56 studies that matched the inclusion criteria. These studies examined public and police officer perceptions of use of force, rates of use of force, types of force used, neighborhood contextual correlates of use of force, and severity of force used. A wide variety of approaches were used to measure use of force, and operationalization of use of force was inconsistent across studies. This indicates a need for high-quality research focusing on comparable operationalization of variables, consistency in measurement, and use of more rigorous research techniques. The use of validated measures is essential moving forward.   Practical implications The practical implications derived from this meta-review indicate a need for future researchers to carefully evaluate the measurement approaches used in use of force studies. The lack of consistency in measurement of use of force research is concerning, and a focused effort is required to validate measures.   Originality/value The state-of-the-art review on measurement issues in police use of force is the first of its kind. This study comprehensively reviews the literature on measurement issues in police use of force. This study will be useful for those who wish to further explore measurement issues in police use of force issues in policing and those who wish to work toward validated use of force measures.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-11-2017-0137?af=R","2018-04-28 08:31:53","130","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"
"10605","Hot Spots of Mental Health Crises","Policing: An International Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose A strong body of research has established the concentration of crime in a small number of street segments or â€œhot spotsâ€ throughout urban cities, but the spatial distribution of mental health-related calls for services is less well known. The extent to which these calls are concentrated on a small number of street segments, similar to traditional crime calls for service is understudied. The purpose of this paper is to examine the concentration of mental health calls and the spatial distribution of street segments with mental health calls to provide directions for law enforcement and place-based policing.   Design/methodology/approach Using call for service data from a large city on the East coast, the current study examines whether mental health calls for service are concentrated on street segments, and tests spatial dispersion to whether these â€œmental health hot spotsâ€ are spread throughout the city or clustered in space. Finally, the authors explore the relationship between mental health calls and violent and drug calls by calculating the correlation and using a spatial point pattern test to determine if mental health calls are spatially similar to violent and drug calls.   Findings The authors found that mental health calls are concentrated on street segments; specifically 22.4 percent of calls are located on 0.5 percent of city street segments. Additionally, these street segments are fairly dispersed throughout the city. When comparing the spatial similarity of mental health calls to violent and drug calls, they are highly correlated suggesting a relationship between the calls types, but the location of mental health calls appears to be different from violet and drug calls.   Originality/value Very few studies have examined the location of mental health calls and whether they are concentrated in small areas similar to crime, but such research can provide police officers new approaches to working with people with mental health problems. The police are the primary emergency response for calls involving someone with a mental illness or experiencing a mental health crisis and the authors provide suggestions for policing that draw from strategies used in hot spot policing and mental health responses, like CIT, to address challenges of modern policing and working with people with mental health problems.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-12-2017-0155?af=R","2018-04-28 08:31:53","106","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

Design/methodology/approach A comprehensive, systematic search of multiple academic databases (e.g. EBSCO Host) was undertaken, supplemented by the use of Google Scholar to search among journals indicated as having cited the articles found in the databases.   Findings A total of 42 studies were identified that met the selection criteria for this meta-review and examined exposure to high-profile incidents involving police, awareness of negative news coverage of police, and/or consumption of specific news mediums (e.g. newspapers). Overall, research supports a relationship between negative perceptions of police and both exposure to high-profile incidents and awareness of negative coverage. Some support for the influence of consuming television news on attitudes exists, but more research is needed on the role of different news sources in shaping perceptions. Future research should also include determining causal pathways and how news about police is selected.   Originality/value This is the first meta-review of the research examining how news media and attitudes about police are related. This study will provide a useful resource for those researchers wishing to continue to examine different aspects of news media consumption as a predictor of perceptions.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-11-2017-0134?af=R","2018-04-28 08:31:53","124","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

Design/methodology/approach A grounded theory approach was utilized for the generation and analysis of the data. Data were collected through interviews, observations and follow-ups. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 male and female volunteer reserve officers and 5 regular police officers aged between 24 and 58 years of mixed socioeconomic backgrounds, ethnicities and ranking in the Royal Malaysia Police force. Two civilian respondents (spouses of the Police Volunteer Reserve officers) were also interviewed for this study for the purpose of theory sampling.   Findings The data were analyzed qualitatively resulting in a model of Royal Malaysia Police Volunteer Reserve officer roles consisting of four orientations.   Research limitations/implications Study outcomes are discussed theoretically and administratively. The four role orientations identified will assist researchers studying police reserve volunteerism.   Practical implications Study outcomes allow administrators to utilize and deploy police reservists in consonance with the four role orientations identified.

"10608","Special Weapons and Tactics Operations","Policing: An International Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose The purpose of this paper is to test the effects of differential police training on hostage rescue effectiveness. More specifically, this study looks at the types of police trainings that are the most effective in preparing Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) officers in dealing with hostage rescue situations.   Design/methodology/approach This study employs a cross-sectional design. The analyses are based on a national sample of 341 law enforcement agencies, which employed at least 50 sworn officers.   Findings To improve the SWAT response effectiveness in hostage rescue situations, this study shows that two factors play a significant role, namely, the training for hostage rescue situations and an increase in the average training hours per month. Among the types of trainings that were thought to be effective but did not show a significant effect in this present study were training for crowd control/civil unrest, having military training, and training for building searches.   Practical implications Increased training hours specifically designed to address hostage situations increases the likelihood of successful hostage extractions. Thus, police departments should have specific training hours set aside for hostage situations.   Originality/value This study attempts to identify specific types of police trainings that have a positive effect on improving SWAT effectiveness in dealing with hostage situations. There is a very limited number of research works on SWAT operations. This study, therefore, adds to this very limited research area of policing.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-11-2016-0161?af=R","2018-04-28 08:31:53","105","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"
"10609","Collaborative Problem-Solving At Youth Crime Hot Spots: A Pilot Study","Policing: An International Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose The purpose of this paper is to describe a case study of a pilot program in which a collaborative problem-solving approach was implemented at hot spots of juvenile and youth crime in downtown Seattle, Washington.   Design/methodology/approach Two matched pairs of youth crime hot spots were allocated at random to treatment (â€œnon-enforcement problem-solvingâ€) or comparison (â€œpolicing-as-usualâ€) conditions within matched pairs. In the treatment condition, police collaborated with community and local government partners to develop problem-solving strategies that deemphasized arrests and other traditional law enforcement approaches. Impacts on crime incidents, calls for service, and police activity were assessed using difference-in-differences Poisson regression with robust standard errors.   Findings No significant impact on crime or calls for service was observed at one site, where several problem-solving approaches were successfully implemented. However, crime and calls for service were significantly lower at the other site, where some enforcement activity took place but non-enforcement problem-solving was limited.   Research limitations/implications The authors find mixed support for non-enforcement problem-solving at hot spots. The enforcement may be necessary for stabilization, and must be balanced with the risks of justice system involvement for youth. Political support at the city level is necessary for collaboration. Limitations include the small number of sites in this pilot study and key differences between treatment and comparison locations.   Originality/value This study is one of the first to assess the impact of primarily non-enforcement problem-solving specifically at youth crime hot spots.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-12-2017-0152?af=R","2018-04-28 08:31:53","110","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

The NZPC has loomed large in the government&rsquo;s evaluations of the decriminalization legislation known as the Prostitution Reform Act (PRA). It has collected information, partnered on the research team appointed by the Ministry of Justice to conduct the research, and ultimately secured seats as evaluators on the Prostitution Law Review Committee (PLRC) charged with assessing the research and making recommendations. Much of its outsized influence on the research and conclusions of this report is demonstrated in the report itself. Perusing the NZPC website offers a view into how entrenched prostitution has become simply another business in New Zealand. The NZPC has also employed tactics of bullying, smearing, and no platforming of feminist critics and survivors who disagree with the Collective&rsquo;s valorization of &ldquo;sex work.&rdquo; These ploys have not stopped a burgeoning global movement of survivors of prostitution and their advocates from speaking out. In 2008, the Review Committee called for a full assessment of the PRA in 2018.

Much of the prior literature is limited by the use of small sample sizes, measures of support without adequately reported psychometric properties, and inadequate or inconsistent definitions of support, which hinders the ability to accurately identify key predictors. Further, some potentially important predictors of parental support remain unexplored, including child-reported abuse stressors (e.g., family conflict, nonsupportive disclosure responses). The present study aimed to better delineate predictors of maternal belief and emotional support by examining the links between child, maternal, and family factors, and abuse characteristics as reported by both mothers and children. Two hundred and forty-seven treatment-seeking children (<italic>M</italic> age&#8239;=&#8239;9.24, <italic>SD</italic>&#8239;=&#8239;3.74) and their non-offending mothers were included in the study. Select demographic factors (i.e., child&rsquo;s age, minority status), abuse characteristics (i.e., use of penetration, repeated CSA incidents, and amount of CSA characteristics known), and child-reported abuse stressors were tied to levels of maternal belief and/or emotional support. Maternal and family characteristics were unrelated to support. The child&rsquo;s age and whether the abuse occurred more than once remained robust predictors of both aspects of support in multivariate analyses. The amount of CSA information known to the mother predicted emotional support, which may signal the utility of increasing parental knowledge of the abuse to bolster their emotional support. Findings indicate that there are several factors that may influence levels of maternal support, and children who experience certain types of CSA may be at greater risk for lower levels of belief and support.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213418301674%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D2a8c9aacc7190a704815709ca7270c1a","2018-04-28 17:00:24","60","Child Abuse and Neglect"

                  <p>This study analyzes the impacts of school-based law enforcement officers on school crime, disciplinary actions, and disciplinary problems in 238 middle and high schools in West Virginia using a non-equivalent groups design and three years of data. Propensity score weights are utilized to reduce selection biases resulting from non-random group assignment in observational data. Binary and multinomial logistic treatment models are used when estimating treatment effects to examine whether the extent to which police officers are present in schools impacts problem outcomes. Findings indicated that while the presence of school police officers increased drug-related crimes and out-of-school suspensions for drug crimes regardless of whether they were present in schools for a single year or multiple years, there were deterrent effects observed for violent crimes and incidents of disorder when police officers were present in schools during all school years. Implications for policy and practice are discussed.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12103-018-9440-z","2018-04-28 22:15:12","67","American Journal of Criminal Justice"

Using a person-centered approach, two IPV-parenting typologies were found: a spillover typology, with high levels of physical, psychological, and sexual violence and high levels of harsh and inconsistent parenting practices; and a compartmentalized typology, with high levels of physical, psychological, and sexual violence and lower ineffective parenting practices. Results also showed that externalizing symptoms (reported by mothers and teachers) were significantly lower in children of mothers in the compartmentalized typology compared to those in the spillover typology. Children's direct exposure to other forms of family violence moderated this association.

Until recently, Switzerland was an exception. That has now changed withAviva Guttmann&rsquo;s Ph.D. thesis turned into a Brill monograph, The Origins of International Counterterrorism.As she notes in her opening chapter, Europe was struck by a series of terrorist attacks in the early 1970s -both by domestic groups and by international terrorist organisations. Mainly due to transnational terroristoperations, Guttmann argues, countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and France started tocooperate, bilaterally, and sometimes, in a very ad hoc manner, multilaterally. However, Dutch, Belgian, Frenchand German police officers already exchanged information and intelligence relating to fugitive domesticterrorists like those of the German RAF and, in later years, with the UK on IRA operatives running afoul on thecontinent. However, with that reservation, Guttmann is correct in noting that governments started to developmore institutionalised policies to counter the threat emanating from international terrorist organisations in theearly 1970s. She also correctly notes that the Swiss government played an interesting part in early developmentson the intelligence front.

One should consider his infatuation withthe Palestinian cause, and especially Turkey&rsquo;s very robust relations with Hamas, the Palestinian radical Islamistmovement, in the larger context of Erdogan and his party&rsquo;s, the Justice and Development Party (AKP), ideologicaland strategic goals. The Islamist inclinations of President Erdogan endanger the already strained relations withIsrael. In addition, they can also undermine relations with the Palestinian Authority and threaten the multifacetedMiddle Eastern arena. Moreover, it seems Erdogan dreams of building an Islamist army, on the Iranian model, tofight for the liberation of Palestine.","http://www.terrorismanalysts.com/pt/index.php/pot/article/view/695","2018-04-30 19:46:50","37","Perspectives on Terrorism"

"10626","Headhunting Among Extremist Organizations: An Empirical Assessment of Talent Spotting","In recent years, terrorism scholars have proposed that more established and popular extremist organizations makepragmatic assessments of their human capital needs and modify operating standards to acquire members withadvanced training and expertise such as medical, religious, or military backgrounds that may benefit extremistactivities. To examine these claims, we rely on data pertaining to 105 extremist organizations gathered throughoutthe Leadership of the Extreme and Dangerous for Innovative Results (LEADIR) project. The results provide empiricalsupport for these propositions by suggesting that older and more publicly supported extremist organizations containmembership populations that possess expertise, and these organizations also become increasingly diverse acrossdemographic characteristics of members. We conclude with suggestions for future research that extend the study ofextremist recruitment and provide recommendations for practitioners in terms of addressing terrorism preventioninitiatives.","http://www.terrorismanalysts.com/pt/index.php/pot/article/view/693","2018-04-30 19:46:50","44","Perspectives on Terrorism"
"10627","Spaces, Ties, and Agency: the Formation of Radical Networks","The literature on radicalization as well as studies on participation in high-risk activism have emphasized the roleof personal ties and radical networks in shaping pathways towards political violence. Yet, our knowledge abouthow these radical networks are formed remains limited. Drawing on an in-depth case study of the network aroundthe so-called &ldquo;Sauerland-Group&rdquo; in Germany, this article examines patterns of network-formation, focusing on: (i)the role and function of different types of social ties in creating and sustaining radical networks; (ii) the importanceof different spaces and events in initiating and reinforcing connections between activists; and (iii) the role ofindividual agency and pro-active connection-making in this process. In a more general sense, this article seeks tocontribute to a better understanding of radicalization as a relational process, emphasizing the fact that individualtrajectories are closely interlinked with radical networks as the dynamic setting of jihadist micro-mobilization.This network facilitates and shapes pathways into violent activism and at the same time is created and constantlyre-shaped by militant activists.","http://www.terrorismanalysts.com/pt/index.php/pot/article/view/692","2018-04-30 19:46:50","38","Perspectives on Terrorism"
"10628","Tackling Terrorismâ€™s Taboo: Shame","This exploratory article provides a conceptual framework for explaining how shame is used by terrorist organizationsin their recruitment and radicalization strategies. Shame is a universal emotion, experienced across all cultures,and as such presents scholars with a platform for easy cross-cultural comparisons of radicalization phenomena.Terrorist use of entitative identities to divide society into adherents and apostates, particularly in the study ofreligious extremists like jihadist entities, provides a verdant ground of understanding how organizations movepeople into higher states of radicalization, and potentially enticing them to engage in terrorism. However, as anaversive emotion, shame&rsquo;s taboo status has, it is suggested here, led scholars to overlook its role in past studiesof radicalization. This article postulates that emotions and identity are an integral aspect of the social self, andbecause of shame&rsquo;s regulatory power over social identity and norm adherence, it should be at the core of the studyof radicalization processes.","http://www.terrorismanalysts.com/pt/index.php/pot/article/view/691","2018-04-30 19:46:50","36","Perspectives on Terrorism"

"10630","Fear, Victimization, and Community Characteristics on Citizen Satisfaction With the Police","Policing: An International Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between fear of victimization, actual victimization, and community-level characteristics on citizen satisfaction with police. This study attempts to clarify important factors in how citizens view the police, while accounting for contextual, neighborhood-level variables.   Design/methodology/approach This study utilized a representative victimization survey conducted in Saginaw, MI in 2015. Utilizing a sample of 824 individuals, an ordinary least-squares model was fit in order to determine the effects of reported victimization, fear of victimization, and neighborhood characteristics on satisfaction with police. The authors utilized interaction terms to model varying effects between the East and West sides of the city.   Findings The study found that fear of victimization was related to lower satisfaction with police, while actual victimization had an inconsistent effect when community satisfaction and collective efficacy were accounted for. The authors found the effect was present only in the more affluent western portion of the city. Furthermore, the authors found that non-white residents reported much lower satisfaction with police than white residents.   Research limitations/implications The authors were unable to disaggregate respondents to smaller geographical units than an East\West measure, which limits the authorsâ€™ ability to discuss small-scale contexts at the block, or block-group level.   Practical implications This study suggests that concerted efforts to reduce fear of crime may increase satisfaction with police, but this effect may be based on neighborhood context. Improving collective efficacy and community satisfaction may provide additional ways to improve citizen satisfaction with police.   Originality/value This paper adds to the literature examining the relationship between victimization, fear of crime, and satisfaction with police.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-08-2017-0097?af=R","2018-05-01 08:31:59","74","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

Design/methodology/approach The authors collected data from 147 patrolling police officers on the basis of convenience sampling using a questionnaire-based survey.   Findings The study noted that professionally committed and satisfied police officers are less likely to leave their organization. In addition, alternative job opportunities strengthen the negative association of professional commitment and job satisfaction with leave intention.   Research limitations/implications This study was conducted at one point of time and the majority of the respondents were male, therefore, the results might be gender biased. This study has implications for policymakers and HR managers.   Practical implications Law enforcement agencies and organizations should develop and sustain workplace environments where professional commitment and job satisfaction can positively influence the leave intentions of their employees. More specifically, it provides insight to the managers to retain talented and commitment employees in their organizations.   Originality/value This study adds to the scant literature on professional commitment and alternative job opportunity in the context of police.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-12-2017-0154?af=R","2018-05-01 08:31:59","80","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"
"10632","Show Cause Analysis","Policing: An International Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose The purpose of this paper is to detect and examine any trends in the self-reported causation of misconduct among officers being considered for dismissal.   Design/methodology/approach The data utilised in this study consisted of show cause notice (SCN) responses. In the process of being considered for dismissal, officersâ€™ may offer the causes of or mitigating factors to their misconduct as a means of avoiding dismissal. This study utilised these responses as a data source. Data collection occurred between January 2013 and October 2016, resulting in a cohort of n=100 responses comprised of between 1 and ~1,000 pages of free text. Qualitative methods were preferred, a conventional content analysis was performed with coding categories derived from SCN response text.   Findings The results of this study indicate noteworthy levels of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and related mental health issues amongst this cohort, as well as pervasive financial and workplace stressors, which officers frequently link to the causation of their misconduct. Of particular note is the consistent co-occurrence of work-related stressors and health issues, most commonly through formally diagnosed PTSD.   Research limitations/implications This study indicates an opportunity for support services to impact positively on mental health and stress, and subsequently misconduct among police officers.   Originality/value There is still very little understanding of the causation of misconduct among police officers. This is the first time that this data have been utilised in any form of the research, it provides valuable insight into a potential alternative method of addressing misconduct to reactionary investigative action.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-06-2017-0079?af=R","2018-05-01 08:31:59","64","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

The purpose of this paper is to explore STS in police officerâ€™s investigating childhood sexual abuse (CSA) in the UK.   Design/methodology/approach This study employed a cross-sectional, quantitative design. An online questionnaire was completed by 101 Child Abuse Investigation Unit (CAIU) police officers in England and Wales. STS, coping strategies, anxiety, depression and demographic information was collected for all participants.   Findings It was indicated that increased exposure to CSA, measured by number of interviews in the past six months, was associated with higher levels of STS. Positive coping strategies, negative coping strategies, anxiety and depression all had a strong, positive relationship with STS.   Research limitations/implications This paper is a first step to understanding STS in CAIU police officers in the England and Wales. This area of research remains under-developed and would benefit from further attention in the future.

"10634","Police Integrity in China","Policing: An International Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the contours of police integrity among Chinese police officers. Specifically, this study explores how Chinese police evaluate integrity based on official policy governing interactions, discipline governing infractions, views of seriousness, and willingness to inform when others engage in misconduct.   Design/methodology/approach In total, 353 police officers were surveyed representing those attending in-service training program at a Chinese police university in May 2015. Questionnaires containing 11 scenarios describing police misbehaviors were distributed to officers during classes.   Findings There was a strong correlation between officersâ€™ perceptions of rule-violation, misconduct seriousness, discipline, and willingness to report. Additionally, preliminary results suggest there exists a code of silence among Chinese officers, and that Chinese officers hold a lenient attitude toward the use of excessive force.   Research limitations/implications This study utilizes a convenient sample, which restricts the generalizability of the results.   Practical implications The results indicate the existence of code of silence among Chinese officers and their lenient attitude toward the use of excessive force.   Originality/value Although there has been a growing body of research examining police integrity in both western democracies and transitional societies, China as the largest developing nation in the world and with a unique police system (falls somewhere between the centralized model and the integrated model) is understudied. This study addresses this gap in previous literature by exploring the contours of police integrity among Chinese police officers.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-01-2017-0008?af=R","2018-05-01 08:31:59","56","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"
"10635","Examining the Extent to Which Repeat and Near Repeat Patterns Can Prevent Crime","Policing: An International Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the extent and variation in the estimates to which crime can be prevented using patterns of repeats and near repeats, and whether hotspot analysis complements these patterns.   Design/methodology/approach Crime data for four study areas in New Zealand are used to examine differences in the extent of burglary repeat and near repeat victimisation. Hotspots of burglary are also created to determine the extent to which burglary repeats and near repeats spatially intersect hotspots.   Findings The extent of repeats and near repeats varies, meaning there is variation in the estimated prevention benefits that repeat and near repeat patterns offer. In addition, at least half of the burglaries repeats and near repeats were not located within hotspots.   Research limitations/implications The use of other techniques for examining crime concentration could be used to improve the research observations.   Practical implications By showing that levels of repeats and near repeats vary, the extent to which these observations coincide in hotspots offers practitioners a better means of determining whether repeat and near repeat patterns are reliable for informing crime prediction and crime prevention activities.   Originality/value The paper is the first known research study that explicitly measures the variation in the extent of repeats and near repeats and the spatial intersection of these patterns within crime hotspots. The results suggest that rather than considering the use of repeat and near repeat patterns as a superior method for predicting and preventing crime, value remains in using hotspot analysis for determining where crime is likely to occur, particularly when hotspot analysis emphasises other locations for resource targeting.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-12-2016-0172?af=R","2018-05-01 08:31:59","105","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"
"10636","Law Enforcement Suicide: A Review","Policing: An International Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose The purpose of this paper is to provide a review of law enforcement suicide research from 1997 to 2016.   Design/methodology/approach The PRISMA systematic review methodology was implemented. A SCOPUS search identified a total of 97 documents. After applying all exclusion criteria, the results included a list of 44 articles in the review.   Findings Overall, studies investigating law enforcement suicide rates show conflicting results, with some studies showing lower suicide rates among law enforcement, some showing higher rates, and some showing no difference to comparison populations. Recurring research themes were lack of an appropriate comparison group, and small statistical power, particularly for minority and female officers. Stressors related to suicide among police included lack of organizational support, traumatic events, shift work, stigma associated with asking for help, or problems associated with fitting in with the police culture. Problems associated with domestic relationships and alcohol use were commonly mentioned as precursors to suicide or as correlates of suicidal ideation and were hypothesized to arise from stressful working conditions.   Research limitations/implications Some limitations in law enforcement suicide research include the lack of theory, under-reporting of suicides, and guarded survey responses from police officers. Future directions in police suicide research include investigating etiological factors such as past adverse life and family experiences, social-ecological variation in suicide, or differences in suicide rates within the law enforcement occupation.   Practical implications Police work, given chronic and traumatic stress, lack of support, danger, and close public scrutiny is a fertile occupation for increased suicide risk. Awareness of the scope of the problem and associated risk factors can help to initiate prevention programs.   Originality/value This paper provides a long-term review of literature regarding police suicidality, with suggestions for research and prevention.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-05-2017-0061?af=R","2018-05-01 08:31:59","100","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

The purpose of this literature review is to explore and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions that have addressed an array of biological markers and physical health outcomes in children and adolescents affected by adversity. PubMed, CINAHL, PsychInfo, Sociological Abstracts databases and additional sources (Cochrane, WHO, NIH trial registries) were searched for English language studies published between January 2007 and September 2017. Articles with a childhood adversity exposure, biological health outcome, and evaluation of intervention using a randomized controlled trial study design were selected. The resulting 40 intervention studies addressed cortisol outcomes (n&#8239;=&#8239;20) and a range of neurological, epigenetic, immune, and other outcomes (n&#8239;=&#8239;22). Across institutional, foster care, and community settings, intervention programs demonstrated success overall for improving or normalizing morning and diurnal cortisol levels, and ameliorating the impacts of adversity on brain development, epigenetic regulation, and additional outcomes in children. Factors such as earlier timing of intervention, high quality and nurturant parenting traits, and greater intervention engagement played a role in intervention success. This study underlines progress and promise in addressing the health impacts of adversity in children. Ongoing research efforts should collect baseline data, improve retention, replicate studies in additional samples and settings, and evaluate additional variables, resilience factors, mediators, and long-term implications of results. Clinicians should integrate lessons from the intervention sciences for preventing and treating the health effects of adversity in children and adolescents.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213418301650%26_version%3D1%26md5%3De318b282a3e3e64295c0cd8c322c4d2a","2018-05-01 17:15:21","72","Child Abuse and Neglect"

St. Clair<br><abstract-sec ns2=""http://webservices.elsevier.com/schemas/search/fast/types/v4"" soapenv=""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"" view=""all""><simple-para view=""all"">The significant mental health needs of young people in out-of-home care has been well-documented. However, there is little empirical evidence on the timing or development of these difficulties, once these young people have been removed from the maltreatment-environment. Such information may provide useful clinical insight in to how problems develop and persist and whether intervention timings may allow for the prevention of later mental health problems. The current service-data study explored the emotional and behavioural symptom trajectories of 207 young people under the long-term care of a local authority in the South West of England, over their first five years in the care system. Data were extracted from the yearly carer-completed strengths and difficulties questionnaire &ndash; providing an index of emotional problems, peer problems, conduct problems and hyperactivity. Trajectories were analysed using growth mixture modelling. For most domains the largest trajectories were chronic symptom profiles, where young people were rated in the abnormal range from their first year in care and remained in this range across the full five years. These young people had significantly more placement moves than their peers on resilient trajectories. There was some evidence that later age of removal was associated with more chronic internalising problems. Overall, findings demonstrate the significant mental health needs of young people in care and particularly highlight that, in many cases, the removal from the adverse environment is simply not enough to expect a young person in care to be resilient to their earlier experiences.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213418301686%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D095db755062846b28b38ca0d4c779f3a","2018-05-02 17:15:27","47","Child Abuse and Neglect"

                  <p>The repression of anti-austerity protests in Spain from 2011 to 2014 constitutes an example of how neoliberal developments are facilitated by the penal system as it <em>limits political resistances</em> to the imposition of precarious working conditions and social cuts. The limits imposed on contentious politics are both material (consisting of banning acts that are prominent in social movement&rsquo;s repertoire of contention, fining demonstrators, etc.) and symbolic (consisting of transforming the meaning of legitimate politics by imposing new legal and political definitions). This case study is used to illustrate the interconnection between labor markets, social policies and the repression of social protest, and to elaborate on Wacquant&rsquo;s approach to the relationship between punishment and other social institutions. It is at such times of political and economic crisis when institutional interconnections seem particularly exposed, arguably enabling more profound analyses.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10611-018-9776-9","2018-05-02 19:15:32","43","Crime, Law and Social Change"

                  <p>Recent theorists have argued that the use of the death penalty has been shaped by political considerations throughout history. However, empirical research has primarily examined this relationship in the last third of the twentieth century. In order to expand the temporal scope used to examine capital punishment practices, this study examines whether four post-<em>Furman</em> perspectives are able to account for the use of death sentences at the state level from 1930 to 2010. This study also examines whether the movement from the pre- to the post-<em>Furman</em> time period moderated the relationship between political factors and use of death sentences. The findings indicate that the size of religious fundamentalist populations, jurisdictional welfare expenditures, and surpluses in the labor force are significant predictors of death sentences across both eras.

                  <p>The aim of this study was to examine the empirical connections of three phenomena among the Finnish population: (1) the level of knowledge on the crime situation and the criminal justice system; (2) the general punitive attitude and (3) sentence decisions in certain concrete crime cases using vignettes. The same vignettes were shown to professional judges to study the punitive gap between laypeople and judges. The research subjects are a representative sample of the population (<em>N</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;1251) and district court judges (<em>N</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;192). The research resulted in four main findings: (1) a higher level of knowledge among laypeople mitigates their punitive attitudes, (2) information included in the case vignettes is associated with the sentence decisions of laypeople in different ways, depending on the characteristics of the case; punitive gap varies greatly, (3) level of knowledge is, in general, a poor predictor for the severity of the sentence decisions of laypeople and (4) the general punitive attitude is, at best, a weak predictor for the severity of sentence decisions of laypeople. In conclusion, laypeople&rsquo;s decisions are probably affected partly by the same legal factors as the professional judges&rsquo; decisions and partly by attitudes that are expressly related to features of the cases in question.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10610-018-9384-3","2018-05-03 07:15:57","38","European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research"

                  <p>Prior research has shown that primary confession evidence can alter eyewitnesses&rsquo; identifications and self-reported confidence. The present study investigated whether secondary confession evidence from a jailhouse informant could have the same effect. Participants (<em>N</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;368) watched a video of an armed robbery and made an identification decision from a photo lineup. Except for those in the no-feedback conditions, all participants then read that certain lineup members either confessed to the crime, denied involvement, or were implicated by a jailhouse informant. Jailhouse informant testimony implicating the identified lineup member led participants to have significantly higher confidence in their identification. In contrast, jailhouse informant testimony that implicated a lineup member other than the identified led participants to have significantly lower confidence in their initial identification, and 80% of these witnesses changed their identification. These results indicate that jailhouse informant testimony can influence eyewitnesses&rsquo; confidence and their identification decisions.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9274-0","2018-05-03 08:16:37","36","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"
"10714","Resilience of Public and Private Security Providers: A State-of-the-Art Literature Review","Policing: An International Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the empirical literature on the resilience of public police officers and private security guards in stressful situations involving threats, violence, accidents or death. This paper studies the definitions of resilience used in these professions, identifies trends in applied research methods and examines the main topics addressed in previous research.   Design/methodology/approach A scoping review was carried out, with searches in Web of Science and Google Scholar, as well as a secondary manual screening in Dutch academic journals. Based on this review, 33 empirical studies were included in the current paper.   Findings First, it was revealed that a clear-cut definition of resilience applied to public police and private security guards is currently lacking. Second, predominantly quantitative designs were found to be used in the selected studies. Third, the 33 empirical studies provided insights on four main topics: demographic factors, personal characteristics, interpersonal aspects and resilience training programs. Remarkably, this scoping review did not find any empirical research on the resilience of private security guards.   Originality/value This study systematically integrates the findings of empirical research on the resilience of security providers to stressful situations. The documentation of research activity, gaps and inconsistencies in the literature offer direction for future research in this relatively new field of study.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-09-2017-0114?af=R","2018-05-03 08:32:15","44","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"
"10715","Examining Officer Support For and Perceived Effects of Police Consolidation","Policing: An International Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose The purpose of this paper is to review officer support for the consolidation of law enforcement agencies.   Design/methodology/approach The current study surveys 139 officers employed by four agencies that have recently undergone a consolidation of police services. The survey asked officers their level of support for consolidation of services as well as their views of how consolidation has affected employment conditions, organizational characteristics, and the delivery of police services.   Findings While officers generally support consolidation, views on the effects of shared services vary significantly by level of support. Officers who most strongly support consolidation are also most likely to view it as leading to improvements in some working conditions (e.g. job satisfaction, morale), elements of organizational capacity (e.g. professionalism, investigative/intelligence capacity, recruitment), and the delivery of services (e.g. cost-effectiveness, quality and efficiency of services, and reductions in crime).   Research limitations/implications The sample size and response rate are low. Still, the study offers insights into officer views of consolidation not previously available.   Practical implications This research offers insights to communities considering the consolidation of police services regarding what organizational, employment, and service conditions are most likely to appeal to officers, whose support is necessary for successful implementation.   Originality/value While single case studies previously considered officer attitudes on these issues, this work is the first to comparatively examine views of shared services across varying levels of support for consolidation.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-07-2017-0086?af=R","2018-05-03 08:32:15","56","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"
"10716","The Influence of Procedural Justice on Citizen Satisfaction With State Law Enforcement","Policing: An International Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose There are a number of individual and contextual variables that influence public opinion of the police but we know little about the public opinion regarding state law enforcement agencies. Prior studies involving municipal police and other criminal justice agencies indicate that the perceptions of procedural justice, or fair treatment, are important predictors of citizen satisfaction with police services. The purpose of this paper is to examine whether individuals who perceive procedurally just treatment during their contact with a state patrol officer improve the levels of satisfaction with the state patrol.   Design/methodology/approach This paper presents the results of a public opinion study (n=846) regarding the Colorado State Patrol conducted in 2009. A subsample of 393 individuals who had contact with the state patrol and were further surveyed about their contact with the officer. Logistic regression models were used to examine individual- and contextual-level variables influence satisfaction with the state patrol and whether this relationship was mediated by the perceptions of procedural justice.   Findings The authors found that individuals who perceive higher levels of procedural justice expressed higher satisfaction with the state patrol. Females, older respondents, and non-white respondents expressed greater satisfaction, as well as those who had voluntary contact or were not arrested. More importantly, procedural justice mediated the effect of involuntary contact and arrest on levels of satisfaction, and while non-white respondents were less likely to experience procedural justice, when levels of procedural justice are controlled for, they have higher levels of satisfaction.   Originality/value The findings emphasize the significance of citizen perceptions of procedural justice during contacts with members of the state patrol. The current study contributes to our knowledge of procedural justice and citizen satisfaction with police encounters given previous research on citizen satisfaction with police focuses almost exclusively on local-level agencies, and research on procedural justice asks the respondents almost exclusively about the police in general.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-02-2017-0026?af=R","2018-05-03 08:32:15","79","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

Recently, forensic DNA data has been used to study unknown offenders. However, DNA data are only a subset of the crimes committed by unknown offenders stored in police recorded crime data. To establish the suitability of DNA data for studying the spatial offending behaviour of unknown offenders, we examine the concentration and spatial similarity of detected but unsolved crimes in police recorded crime data (N&#8239;=&#8239;181,483) and DNA data (N&#8239;=&#8239;1913) over 27 Belgian judicial districts for four crime types.

"10733","Penal Monitoring in the United States: Lessons From the American Experience and Prospects For Change","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>While independent penal monitoring has a history as old as the prison itself, the United States has historically lacked a robust system of monitoring at the federal, state and local level. Studies of the protection of human rights in prisons, and growing experience with robust monitoring systems, like those promoted by the United Nations through the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture (OPCAT) and the Council of Europe highlight the peril for the United States which is not a signatory to OPCAT and has largely failed to create adequate independent systems of monitoring. When practiced routinely monitoring creates conditions that make extreme turns in penal policy less likely and protect human rights in prisons when populist pressures do build. That peril has come to pass as mass incarceration policies have made overcrowding ubiquitous and undiscovered violations of human rights on a mass scale almost inevitable. Instead of routine independent monitoring, the US has relied almost exclusively on judicial decrees, some of which involve independent monitoring. Unfortunately, while courts have great power to order reforms, and have under some conditions produced systemic prison reforms, the adversarial nature of American legalism makes standards based on litigation subject to enforcement resistance by correctional systems. Even this path, however, has been largely foreclosed by the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1996 (PLRA) which largely cut off prisoner access to the federal courts just as prisons were entering the most perilous phase of overcrowding. Yet it is possible that today the growing human rights crisis in prison and the loss of confidence in correctional leadership to fix those problems is opening up space to place independent penal monitoring at the center of human rights protection in prisons. As the US carceral state enters profound crisis of legitimacy monitoring, in prisons and in analog form across the carceral state institutions, can play a crucial role in making correctional governance both more legitimate and more effective at promoting the human rights of prisoners.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10611-017-9724-0","2018-05-04 01:45:27","31","Crime, Law and Social Change"

                    <h3>Purpose</h3>
                    <p>The current study examines how cumulative adversity in childhood is related to both frequency of offending and criminal career length in adulthood. Specifically we examine (1) whether multiple adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) predict criminal career length and frequency of offending, and (2) if the formation of adult bonds mediates the relationship between adversity in childhood with persistent and chronic offending in adulthood.</p>

                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>Analyses use data on a population of several hundred individuals who have committed numerous violent offenses and have criminal careers of up to 56&nbsp;years in length (<em>N</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;401). Path analysis was used to estimate the total, indirect, and direct effects of the accumulation of multiple adversities on two key dimensions of a criminal career: career length and frequency of offending.</p>

                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>Results indicate the pathway to frequent offending differs from the pathway to criminal career length. Prosocial bonds did not mediate the relationship between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and criminal career length; instead, there was a significant direct effect of ACEs on career length. On the other hand, ACEs were negatively and indirectly related to frequency of offending through the particular bond of employment.</p>

                    <p>Results suggest that early years are important for initiating trajectories of disadvantage; at the same time our results also demonstrate a role for interventions across the life course. Early interventions that attempt to diminish the impact of negative beginnings as well as interventions that facilitate efforts to build social capital during adulthood may have the ability to redirect trajectories.</p>

                  <p>Literature reviews in criminological and criminal justice journal articles have long served as an integral component in our empirical backyard. In this address I explore the value of the literature review in peer-reviewed research articles. I begin by evaluating the merits of the literature review section in empirically refereed research articles. I propose abandoning the literature review, due to its overall insignificance and best practices from other disciplines. Based on reasons outlined in this speech, I elaborate on the strengths and weaknesses of this somewhat controversial notion in the criminological/criminal justice discipline.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12103-018-9442-x","2018-05-04 20:30:12","49","American Journal of Criminal Justice"

The current study assesses public confidence in police in South Africa by analyzing data from a more than three-decade-old public opinion survey. The purpose of this paper is twofold: first, to examine changes in public confidence since 1981; and second, to determine factors that cause variations in confidence during a given period.   Design/methodology/approach To achieve the objectives, the authors analyzed longitudinal data collected from 1981 to 2014 as part of the world Value Survey program. ANOVA and multivariate regression analyses were conducted.   Findings Findings indicate that confidence in SAPS was highest during the period immediately after apartheid and then dwindled from 1999 onwards. Moreover, race, happiness and education have historically influenced public confidence in the police.   Originality/value These findings provide information that could be useful for transforming the SAPS, especially in developing viable strategies to strengthen the policeâ€™s relationship with citizens. Additionally, the manuscript provides an original contribution to the study of public attitudes toward the police and police legitimacy, especially in a non-western society.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-06-2017-0074?af=R","2018-05-05 08:31:55","62","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

The data derive from Longitudinal Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect (LONGSCAN), which tracks the consequences of child abuse and neglect using five study sites across the US. Child physical and sexual abuse was measured at age 12 using self-reports of life-time maltreatment experiences. Internalizing and externalizing symptoms were assessed at age 12 using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Peer popularity was assessed at age 14 by teachers. Peer victimization was assessed at age 16 using the modified version of the Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire. The results indicated that physical abuse had no direct effect on either physical or sexual peer victimization, whereas sexual abuse had significant direct effect on both physical and sexual victimization. Assessed at age 12, children who had been physically or sexually maltreated were found to have higher levels of internalizing and externalizing symptoms. These increased symptoms are associated with lower peer popularity at age 14, which in turn is associated with greater physical and sexual peer victimization at age 16. The findings suggest that multiple points for interventions may exist to disrupt the cycle of victimization. Early assessment and treatment for externalizing symptoms and for low peer popularity may be helpful in preventing physical peer victimization among adolescents who have been physically and/or sexually abused.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213418301844%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D8ff3e4b9ee4a27d9ee89f0e959d581c2","2018-05-05 17:30:19","49","Child Abuse and Neglect"

Past studies suggest that CCSOs share their experiences and emotions with targeted youths (self-disclosure grooming tactic) and encourage them to reciprocate, to build trust and closer relationships through a cycle of self-disclosures. In this study, we examined 36,029 words in 4,353 messages within 107 anonymized online chat sessions by 21 people, specifically 12 youths and 9 arrested sex offenders (5 CCSOs and 4 FCSOs), using SDA. Results showed that CCSOs were more likely than FCSOs to write online messages with specific words (first person pronouns, negative emotions and positive emotions), suggesting the use of self-disclosure grooming tactics. CCSO&rsquo;s self-disclosure messages elicited corresponding self-disclosure messages from their targeted youths. These results suggest that CCSOs use grooming tactics that help engender youths&rsquo; trust to meet in the physical world, but FCSOs do not.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213418301534%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D827caaf4f6cf9b43b27875edfa962b25","2018-05-05 17:30:19","59","Child Abuse and Neglect"

In this study ICAST-P, an internationally recognized tool, was used with mothers reporting on one of their children up to their 12th birthday. It questions about disciplinary methods: nonviolent; physical: moderate and severe; and psychological methods that had been used in the previous year on the index child in the family. A comparative national cross-sectional household survey of mothers aged 25&ndash;50 years old was conducted in both Qatar and Palestine, both Arabic Muslim states, but with very different socio-economic and political contexts that place Qataris in a much more advantageous position. Our results show that the 1299 Palestinian mothers interviewed were younger, had more children and less education compared to the 1018 Qatari mothers. Fewer mothers from Palestine were working. The index child in Palestine tended to be younger with 60% being under 5 years, while 73.7% of Qatari children were over 5 years of age. Severe physical disciplinary methods were reported significantly more often, in Palestine, e.g. Kicking the child (P value&#8239;&amp;lt;&#8239;0.001), using hand or pillow to prevent breathing (P value&#8239;&amp;lt;&#8239;0.001) and hitting child with object or fist (P value&#8239;&amp;lt;&#8239;0001). Moderate as well as psychological disciplinary methods were also significantly higher among Palestinian mothers (P value&#8239;&amp;lt;&#8239;0.001). Our results suggest that challenging circumstances that Palestinian mothers experience, as compared to their Qatari peers, are associated with greater prevalence of the harsher forms of discipline.

However, there is not a clear evidence base substantiating the role of rape myth acceptance in sexual violence, nor any reviews of recent literature. This review systematically searched relevant Psychology and Social Science databases in Autumn 2016, in order to collate cross-sectional and longitudinal research on the association between rape myth acceptance and self-reported sexual violence. The analysis established associations between these variables in all but one study (Warren, Swan, &amp;amp; Allen, 2015), and two longitudinal studies demonstrated that rape myth acceptance differentiates non-perpetrators from those who go on to exhibit sexual violence behaviours. These findings provide support for the targeting of rape myth acceptance in primary prevention strategies. However, a number of failings within this literature were also identified: instruments used to analyse rape myth acceptance were widely varied; the comprehensiveness of study reporting was universally flawed; measures were rarely taken to ensure participants were heterosexual men; and there remains a dearth of longitudinal evidence, as well as a lack of research outside of the United States.

At the same time, the dark side of this growth/benefit has led to increased hate speech and terrorism as most common and powerful threats globally. Hate speech is an offensive kind of communication mechanism that expresses an ideology of hate using stereotypes. Hate speech targets different protected characteristics such as gender, religion, race, and disability. Control of hate speech can be made using different national and international legal frameworks. Any intentional act directed against life or related entities causing a common danger is known as terrorism. There is a common practice of discussing or debating hate speech and terrorism separately. In the recent past, most of the research articles have discussed either hate speech or terrorism. Hate speech is a type of terrorism and follows an incident or trigger event of terrorism. Online social networks are the result of ITs and evolved rapidly through the popularity among youth. As both the activities are near to close and makes use of online social networks, the collective discussion is appropriate. Therefore we have a review on hate speech with different classes and terrorism with cyber use in the framework of online social networks. With the help of combined effort from the government, the Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and online social networks, the proper policies can be framed to counter both hate speech and terrorism efficiently and effectively.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS1359178917301064%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D0bb91e4ec7b126931220eadcde968b1d","2018-05-06 04:30:14","53","Aggression and Violent Behavior"

We report on overall male:female (M:F) ratios, and variations in these by age (or grade), by survey time point, and by offline/online bullying. We also compare consistency of M:F ratios across countries, over the five surveys. The preponderance of male perpetrators of bullying is found consistently across surveys, and survey time point. It is also consistent by age, but HBSC data suggest a curvilinear trend in early adolescence. Males also tend to more frequently be victims of bullying, consistent across age and survey time point, but with variations by survey. There is some indication of a decrease in M:F ratio recently in mid-adolescence, possibly related to online bullying. At least relatively, females are more involved as victims of online than offline bullying. Comparing recent findings on M:F ratio across countries for the five surveys, correlations vary from high to near zero. Implications for the explanation of gender differences in different countries, the comparability of data from different surveys, and for gender-specific interventions, are discussed.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS1359178917304020%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D11aa69762311598132413fa9cffb56c9","2018-05-06 04:30:14","66","Aggression and Violent Behavior"

Over the last decade, the preoccupation over the use of electronic means of communication as a tool to convey hate, racist and xenophobic contents rose tremendously. NGOs, legal professionals, private companies, and civil society have developed interventions but little is known about their impact. For this review we followed the method and protocol from the guidelines from the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook for Systematic Reviews and the Campbell Collaboration Crime and Justice guidelines. The review identified three key intervention areas: law, technology and education through the empowerment of the individuals under the form of counter-speech. No specific intervention towards aggressors was found and most projects focus on prevention or victims through confidence building and skills learning to speak out, report and potentially react in an appropriate way. We did not find any rigorously assessed interventions, which highlights a gap in research and stresses the need for this type of studies. The evaluation of effectiveness of interventions needs to be included in the near future research agenda. Up to now, although intentions are good, we have no evidence that the steps that are undertaken are effective in preventing and reducing cyberhate.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS1359178918300028%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Df913f2f443a3bb0a5c3995a8ac731cf8","2018-05-06 04:30:14","79","Aggression and Violent Behavior"

The present meta-analysis aimed to extend previous work on the maltreatment-antisocial relation by focusing on prospective longitudinal studies that have followed-up participants into adulthood. General, maltreatment and abusive intimate partner violent behaviors were included as outcomes. A total of 14 studies including 18 independent samples and 20,946 individuals were considered. Our results revealed that maltreated youth are nearly two times as likely to engage in antisocial behaviors in adulthood compared with their non-maltreated peers (<italic>OR</italic>&#8239;=&#8239;1.96; CI[1.42, 2.71]). The relation between maltreatment and antisocial behavior was stronger when less covariates or the bivariate associations between them were considered, and maltreatment assessed in both childhood and adolescent years was more strongly related to the antisocial outcome. Nevertheless, the maltreatment-antisocial behavior link prevailed in the contrasting conditions, i.e., maltreatment assessed in childhood or in adolescent years, in multivariate analyses.

"10764","Pornography As A Public Health Issue: Promoting Violence and Exploitation of Children, Youth, and Adults","<p>The pornography industry is expanding exponentially as a result of ongoing techonological advances. The ability to stream videos over the internet and the ubiquity of the smart phone have meant that pornography producers are able to use algorithms to target potential consumers, to cultivate new sexual tastes and to deliver content to a more diverse audience over mobile devices. The advent of virtual reality pornography with interactive sex toys and sex robots imbued with artificial intelligence promises to unleash a further step-change in the extent to which pornography influences &lsquo;real-world&rsquo; sexual culture. The critical analysis of pornography undertaken over decades largely by feminist academics and activists has produced a compelling account of how pornography serves to manipulate ordinary sexual interests and direct consumers towards more extreme content. The objectification of pornography performers and the promotion of the idea that they are consenting are both essential strategies to allow normal men (and, though less often, women) to feel comfortable with their pornography viewing. Drawing on interational academic literature from a range of disciplines, together with evidence from popular culture, contemporary news, and criminal law cases, this paper examines the growing body of evidence that pornography plays a pivotal and causal role in shaping real-world sexual behaviours and expectations. As the increasingly brutal fantasies represented in pornography continue to inform expectations for sexual experiences, the evidence for the detrimental consequences of this also proliferates. The nature and extent of these detrimental consequences are explored particularly with reference to three population groups: women, adolescents, and children. Having described the nature of modern pornographic content and isolated pornography as an important agent of change in sexual culture, this paper then explores the connection between the the behaviours celebrated in gonzo porn and real-world sexual violence towards women. The promotion of sexually risky practices to adolescents through pornography has a material impact on sexual health as well as social wellbeing. The long-term effects of this can only be guessed at, since no generation has previously been saturated with such extreme sexual content available through such a variety of media. Measurable health outcomes as well as self-reported effects on teenagers highlight the dangers of the current trajectory. Finally, the dangers to children are empahsised in a discussion of how the fantasies encouraged by &lsquo;pseudo child porn&rsquo; genres engender a sexual interest in genuine child exploitation material (CEM), which in turn increases the risk of contact abuse for children. CEM is also used by paedophiles to groom future victims and forms &lsquo;currency&rsquo; within online communities of men with paedophilic interests. The rise of child-on-child sexual assault can, in many cases, be causally linked to children&rsquo;s access to pornography or to previous experience of sexual abuse, which is very often filmed.</p>","http://digitalcommons.uri.edu/dignity/vol3/iss2/8","2018-05-06 16:30:50","46","Dignity: A Journal on Sexual Exploitation and Violence"

                  <p>This population-based time-trend study examines gun violence rates among males in Sweden during the years 1996 to 2015 and compares the rate in Sweden to other Western European countries. Data were collected from six registries and are presented descriptively per 100,000 inhabitants. The risks among males in Sweden increased considerably in both lethal and non-lethal gun victimization and perpetration. Among males aged 15 to 29 there was a five-fold increase in risk for victimization in lethal and non-lethal gun violence during the 20-year observation period. In a comparative perspective the rate of gun homicide victimization among males 15 to 29&nbsp;years was higher in Sweden compared to other Western European countries, while the risk for males over age 30 was at an average level. Based on the results of this study we conclude that gun violence among young males in Sweden has been on the rise and is at a high level compared to other Western European countries. The development of gun violence in Sweden can be characterized as endemic, prevalent in both population and socially vulnerable areas.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10610-018-9387-0","2018-05-07 01:15:52","51","European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research"

The Massachuetts Child Trauma Project (MCTP), funded by the Administration of Children and Families, Children&rsquo;s Bureau was a multi-year project implementing trauma-informed care into child welfare service delivery. The project&rsquo;s implementation design included training and consultation for mental health providers in three evidence-based treatments and training of the child-welfare workforce in trauma-informed case work practice. The learning was integrated between child-welfare and mental health with Trauma Informed Leadership Teams which included leaders from both systems and the greater community. These teams developed incremental steps toward trauma-informed system improvement. This study evaluated whether MCTP was associated with reductions in child abuse and neglect, improvements in placement stability, and higher rates of permanency during the first year of implementation. Children in the intervention group had fewer total substantiated reports of maltreatment, including less physical abuse and neglect than the comparison group by the end of the intervention year. However, children in the intervention group had more maltreatment reports (substantiated or not) and total out-of-home placements than did their counterparts in the comparison group. Assignment to MCTP, however, was not associated with an increase in kinship care or adoption. Overall, the results are promising in reinforcing the importance of mobilizing communities toward improvements in child-welfare service delivery.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213418301832%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D5aec1c2ff0f056332c5380e376657b4e","2018-05-07 08:30:22","48","Child Abuse and Neglect"

                    <p>We address several issues concerning standard error bias in pooled time-series cross-section regressions. These include autocorrelation, problems with unit root tests, nonstationarity in levels regressions, and problems with clustered standard errors.</p>

                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>We conduct unit root test for crimes and other variables. We use Monte Carlo procedures to illustrate the standard error biases caused by the above issues in pooled studies. We replicate prior research that uses clustered standard errors with difference-in-differences regressions and only a small number of policy changes.</p>

                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>Standard error biases in the presence of autocorrelation are substantial when standard errors are not clustered. Importantly, clustering greatly mitigates bias resulting from the use of nonstationary variables in levels regressions, although in some circumstances clustering can fail to correct for standard error biases due to other reasons. The &ldquo;small number of policy changes&rdquo; problem can cause extreme standard error bias, but this can be corrected using &ldquo;placebo laws&rdquo;. Other biases are caused by weighting regressions, having too few units, and having dissimilar autocorrelation coefficients across units.</p>

                    <h3>Data</h3>

                    <p>The analysis coded the recommended number of days in prison for each offense type based on guidelines set out by the Danish Office of Public Prosecutions. The sentencing value from the prosecutor guidelines was reviewed by five prosecutors. The reliability between the prosecutor ratings and the prosecutor guidelines&rsquo; sentencing value was calculated by using Cronbach&rsquo;s alpha (<em>&alpha;</em>&nbsp;=&thinsp;0.93).</p>

We analyzed 2012 National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System Child File data using generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to examine a sample of children reported to the CWS for CSA (<em>n</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;179,199). GLMMs indicated that among children reported for CSA, Black (<em>AOR</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;1.12) and White (<em>AOR</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;1.17) children had significantly higher odds of case substantiation compared to Latinx children, controlling for other factors. Main effects indicate older children (in mean-centered years; <em>OR</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;1.09) and female children (<em>OR</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;2.52) had higher odds of substantiation. Out of the states included in the post-hoc analysis, 16 (84%) had female to male substantiation ratios that were higher for Latinx children compared to White children. In these same states, only 9 (56%) had ratios for Black children that were higher than the rate for White children. Results indicate it is critical to continue examining how child sex, race/ethnicity, age, and state differences may affect CSA case substantiation rates. These findings underscore the importance of providing accessible culturally and linguistically appropriate CWS services that are also responsive to sex and developmental stage.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-9967-2","2018-05-07 19:16:26","37","Journal of Family Violence"

"10782","Situational Dynamics and the Emergence of Violence in Protests.","Objectives: This article investigates how situational dynamics influence the emergence of protest violence. Although common-sense explanations of violence focus on actors&rsquo; motivations and strategies, a situational turn is underway, emphasizing the relevance of the violent situation itself. This article assesses this situational approach, examining whether the emergence of violence can be explained by focusing on what occurs during a protest. Method: The article comparatively analyzes 30 protests occurring in the United States and Germany between 1960 and 2010. Using a triangulation of visual and document data, as well as participant observation, it analyzes over 1,000 data pieces, uses 2 samples, and conducts 3 steps of analysis: The article develops a situational approach using meticulous case reconstructions (employing Video Data Analysis), tests the approach by comparatively analyzing a random sample of violent and peaceful protests (employing Qualitative Comparative Analysis), and revisits cases to identify crucial dynamics and paths to protest violence. Results: The study identifies 5 behaviors by protesters and police during protests crucial for leading to violence if they occur in one of the following three combinations: a loss of control path, a missing information path, and an offense path. All 3 combinations trigger violence by changing actors&rsquo; situational interpretations and emotional dynamics. Conclusions: Findings suggest a purely situational approach&mdash;focusing on what happens during demonstrations&mdash;can provide a consistent and meaningful explanation for the emergence of violence. Alternative explanations are discussed, such as the relevance of background and context factors as risk factors to the emergence of violence.

"10783","Differences in the Type and Sequence Order of Self-Defense Behaviors During A High-Risk Victimization Scenario: Impact of Prior Sexual Victimization.","Objective: During a potential sexual assault experience, an active, assertive behavioral response to threat (BRTT) can be protective, whereas a nonassertive BRTT may increase risk. However, little is known about how the sequence of behaviors that a woman engages in during a threatening situation may be related to sexual victimization. The present study investigated the style and sequence of behaviors in college women&rsquo;s BRTT using a laboratory-based date rape self-defense scenario. Method: A total of 135 college women (113 with a history of sexual victimization) completed a laboratory-based self-defense scenario in which the threat stimuli and situational context were standardized. Participants also completed a comprehensive assessment of multiple BRTT styles and the sequence of behaviors used. Results: Most participants endorsed likely using multiple BRTT styles during the hypothetical scenario. Participants with a history of sexual victimization were more likely to endorse diplomatic-style and immobile-style behaviors and using immobile behaviors earlier in the sequence than participants without a victimization history. Conclusions: Previous research has typically assessed whether respondents are likely to engage in one type of BRTT. The present results indicate that women often anticipate using multiple BRTT strategies and that these strategies are likely situation dependent. Further, women with a history of sexual victimization may use different BRTT styles likely as a result of their prior traumatization.

"10784","Violence As Work: Ethnomethodological Insights Into Military Combat Operations.","Objective: The objective of this article is to outline an ethnomethodological approach to the study of professionalized violence or violence as work. It focuses primarily on violence in the context of military combat operations and the &ldquo;situational&rdquo; analyses and assessments military personnel themselves undertake when engaging in violent action. Method: We use a video from one incident (WikiLeaks&rsquo; Collateral Murder release) as a demonstration case to set out the methodological bases of ethnomethodological studies of combat violence. As part of this study, we show how transcripts can be used to document the interactions in which situational analyses feature as part of coordinating and executing linked attacks. Results: Based on the video and our transcripts, we explicate how the military personnel involved collaboratively identified, assessed, and engaged a group of combatants. We show that the incident consisted of 2 attacks or engagements, a first and a follow-up, treated as connected rather than distinct by those involved on situational grounds. Conclusion: Moving beyond controversy, causal explanations, and remedies, the article describes how structures of practical military action can be investigated situationally from an ethnomethodological perspective using video data. By treating collaborative military methods and practices as a focus for inquiry, this article contributes to our understanding of violence as work more broadly.

"10785","Situational Factors and Mechanisms in Pathways to Violence.","Background: A large body of research has produced vast quantities of empirical data on risk factors for violence in a range of countries and community contexts. Despite the unquestionable successes of this research in cataloguing these risk factors, relatively little is known about the situational factors and mechanisms that translate risks for violence into enactments of violence itself. Without stronger explanations of these situational pathways to violence, understandings of violence remain &ldquo;fuzzy.&rdquo; This special issue aims to address this important limitation through a focus on the situational dimensions of violence. Key points: Although directly observing violence is often ethically and methodologically challenging, the studies in this special issue demonstrate the value of better understanding the situational contexts that shape the well-documented affective, interactional, and behavioral variables and processes that constitute violent enactments. Examining these processes and factors as they unfold in situ can advance and deepen theoretical and empirical research on general risks for violence. Implications: Situations in which violence is enacted, and the mechanisms through which it is realized, can and should be systematically studied as part of any attempt to enhance the resolution of existing knowledge with respect to violence. Empirical and theoretical research that attempts to get &ldquo;closer&rdquo; to violence offers important and innovative insights and opportunities for understanding violence itself, alongside its causes, correlates, and consequences. Investing in the design of robust studies of the situational dimensions of violence is important for advancing the field of violence scholarship and potentially informing policy and intervention practices.

"10786","How Violence Happens (or Not): Situational Conditions of Violence and Nonviolence in Bahrain, Tunisia, and Syria.","Objective: Recent studies show that violence is difficult to accomplish and only occurs under particular situational circumstances&mdash;but does this also apply to protests in authoritarian regimes? This article investigates the microdynamics of violence during the antiregime protests in Tunisia, Syria, and Bahrain. Method: The argument is based on visual data analysis of video footage of violent and nonviolent interactions from the uprisings in Bahrain, Tunisia, and Syria, as well as human rights reports, interviews with participants of demonstrations, and observation of a demonstration. Results: The article shows how violence by the state and protesters occurred when the perpetrator attacked from afar/above, from behind, at night, or from a vehicle, or attacked the outnumbered. In a few situations, violence was avoided when protesters confronted the security forces face to face. Conclusions: The article supports Randall Collins&rsquo;s argument (2008) that situational conditions allowing the perpetrator to overcome barriers of tension and fear are necessary for violence to occur, even in authoritarian regimes. However, situational dynamics can explain how but not why violence occurs, and Collins&rsquo;s guidelines for activists of how to avoid police violence are no panacea in authoritarian regimes.

"10787","On the Justification of Intergroup Violence: the Roles of Procedural Justice, Police Legitimacy, and Group Identity in Attitudes Toward Violence Among Indigenous People.","Objective: Why do people justify intergroup violence? We examine public attitudes toward violence perpetrated by indigenous activists to claim for rights and violence by police officers against indigenous people. We assess the roles that group identity, perceived police legitimacy, and procedurally just policing toward indigenous people play in the justification of intergroup violence among members of that minority group. Method: We present findings from 2 surveys (Study 1, n = 1,493; Study 2, n = 198) and an experiment (Study 3, n = 76) conducted among indigenous people in Chile. Studies 1 and 2 measure, and Study 3 manipulates, perceptions of police procedural justice toward indigenous people. Effects of procedural justice on police legitimacy (Studies 2 and 3) and attitudes toward violence for social change and social control (Studies 1&ndash;3) are analyzed. Result: Higher perceptions of procedurally just policing toward indigenous people predict higher support for police violence and lower support for violence perpetrated by indigenous activists. These effects are mediated by perceived police legitimacy and moderated by identification with the minority group. Among indigenous people who identify strongly with their group, perceiving high procedural justice predicts greater police legitimacy, greater support for police violence, and lesser support for violence perpetrated by indigenous activists. Conclusions: Findings contribute to an emerging literature on the roles of procedural justice and legitimacy in violence perceptions. They suggest that fair, respectful, and neutral treatment by police officers toward indigenous people may shape people&rsquo;s views on the appropriateness of various forms of police and civic violence in a particular intergroup context.

"10788","â€œRisk Factorsâ€ in Action: the Situated Constitution of â€œRiskâ€ in Violent Interactions.","Objectives: The objective of this report was to consider some ways in which a range of phenomena commonly treated as &ldquo;risk factors&rdquo; for violence (including social asymmetries based on factors such as gender, race, and class and drug or alcohol intoxication) become observable in violent (or potentially violent) interactions. In doing so, we contribute to a growing body of research focused on moving beyond cataloguing factors abstractly associated with risk for violent outcomes, toward specifying the ways in which these risk factors are constituted in &ldquo;doing violence&rdquo; itself. Method: We used an ethnomethodological and conversation analytic approach to examine the sequential unfolding of interactions in which violent actions are projected and/or realized, drawing on a collection of 105 videos downloaded from the video sharing site YouTube. Results: Our analysis demonstrates how participants in the interactions orient to or deploy &ldquo;risk factors&rdquo; as resources for the production of actions and/or for interpreting or accounting for the actions of themselves and others before, during, or after the production of violent actions. Conclusions: The findings demonstrate that the target phenomena, rather than simply being abstracted &ldquo;risk factors&rdquo; (in a distal or &ldquo;upstream&rdquo; sense), are constitutive features of the in situ unfolding of conflicts in which violence comes to be projected (if not always realized) as an outcome. As a result, the ontological distance between &ldquo;risk&rdquo; and &ldquo;enactments&rdquo; of violence effectively dissolves when episodes in which these phenomena appear are subjected to detailed analysis.

"10789","Multilevel Influences on Menâ€™s Partner Violence Justification, Control Over Family Decisions, and Partner Violence Perpetration in Bangladesh.","Objective: Men&rsquo;s justification of intimate partner violence (IPV), control, and IPV perpetration persist globally. We tested feminist theories of dominant masculinity norms and gendered social learning in childhood to explain young married men&rsquo;s violent attitudes and behaviors. Method: The sample was ever-married&mdash;junior men (18&ndash;29 years, n = 774), senior men (30&ndash;54 years, n = 2,398), and women (15&ndash;49 years, n = 3,841)&mdash;in 307 communities from the 2007 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey. Two-level logistic regression models tested whether community norms of masculine dominance and childhood exposure to father-on-mother IPV were associated with higher odds of justifying IPV, controlling family decisions, and perpetrating physical IPV. Results: Compared with senior men, junior men more often justified IPV, controlled family decisions, and perpetrated physical IPV in the prior year; junior men also more often were exposed as children to father-on-mother IPV. In multilevel models, witnessing father-on-mother IPV in childhood and living amid stronger norms of masculine dominance were associated, respectively, with higher adjusted odds of justifying IPV (adjusted odds ratios [aORs] = 1.86 and 33.45), controlling family decisions (aORs = 2.03 and 25.03), and perpetrating physical IPV (aORs = 3.19 and 3.39). Conclusion: Findings support a situational, feminist social ecological model of the influences of community norms of masculine dominance and of gendered social learning on young men&rsquo;s violent attitudes and behavior in marriage. Promoting positive masculinities and reducing men&rsquo;s exposure to violence in childhood may be needed to curtail violence against women in Bangladesh and similar settings.

Child welfare workers are charged with assessing and determining when a child is in need of protection, including when it is necessary to intervene on behalf of children when their caregivers&rsquo; abilities and/or situation is deemed to put them at risk of abuse or neglect. Although the child welfare workforce in Ontario attended to an estimated 125,281 child maltreatment investigations in 2013, little is known about the skills, education, and experiences of these investigating workers. Notwithstanding assumptions about the qualifications and characteristics necessary for effective child welfare practice, few studies explicitly link the specific characteristics of workers to children, youth, and families achieving positive case outcomes. These assumptions have been shaped by a multitude of factors including knowledge of human resources, professional standards, and educational requriements. This study examined data from five cycles over twenty years of Ontario Incidence Studies (-1993, -1998, -2003, -2008, -2013) to provide a profile of child welfare workers. This is the first study to examine the changing profile of child welfare workers in any province in Canada and provides a foundation for developing effective recruitment and professional development strategies, and promoting a positive work environment. Policy and practice implications for the changing needs of these families are discussed.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213418301893%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Dac2cd3345c363e6f4f09e3c99a48552d","2018-05-08 08:30:21","36","Child Abuse and Neglect"

Extant research has been primarily undertaken in the USA and it is important to understand whether similar factors associated with recurrence actually hold in the Australian context. Administrative data were obtained for a sample of 9608 children first subject to a screened-in report in 2011&ndash;12. Children were followed for 12 months. Cox Proportional Hazard models were used to measure associations between 26 independent variables and four types of recurrence: subsequent reports, subsequent investigations, subsequent substantiations, and subsequent intervention. Factors associated with recurrence in Australia were broadly similar to those identified in other jurisdictions, including reports and substantiation for neglect, younger age, prior child protection involvement in the household, and parental characteristics including drug use, mental health problems, and history of maltreatment as a child. As in previous studies, post-investigative service provision was positively associated with recurrence. In prior US research, race did not predict recurrence. However, in the present study, Indigenous Australian children were significantly more likely to be subject to all types of recurrence measured. Future research on recurrence should aim to disentangle the complex relationships between child protection recurrence, child maltreatment, and service delivery. Recurrence is not a good proxy indicator of child safety. The findings have implications for the equity of recurrence-based risk assessment tools as they are applied to indigenous populations.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213418301984%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D650b5045ca9f60f2bc0e279188a713d0","2018-05-08 08:30:21","63","Child Abuse and Neglect"

The studies generally show strong public support for the long-term or indefinite retention of DNA from convicts and suspects. There is considerable support for the retention of DNA from all or some arrestees and potentially the entire population. This was predicated upon the belief that forensic DNA databases have crime-solving abilities, which the public rate highly. In the UK, it was found that the current Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 regime is broadly representative of the recommendations of the surveyed British public. Nevertheless, the studies highlighted a gap in forensic DNA education among the public, suggesting that public views may not be well informed. Overall, there was clear evidence of privacy concerns and the potential misuse of DNA records among the public, with a significant number opposing the retention of DNA from the innocent. It was found that most of the studies were qualitative or non-representative of the relevant population, limiting the generalisation of the results. There was also limited studies among a representative sample of primary stakeholders who are well-informed or directly exposed to the benefits, challenges and risks associated with DNA retention. A research into stakeholders rating of different forensic DNA retention regimes is therefore highly recommended. This is important because the studies suggest divergent views among criminal justice professionals and other members of the public, with the former expressing expansive views and the latter expressing restrictive views. The primary stakeholder's survey will help establish whether the relevant safeguards have been put in place to protect both public security and individual interests.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS1355030618301382%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D4f08c6642caed80bca93084ceb577956","2018-05-08 20:03:00","84","Science and Justice"

Tickets are purchased by complicit travellers or resellers from the online blackmarket. Victim travellers obtain tickets from fake travel agencies or malicious insiders. Compromised credit cards used to be the main method to purchase tickets illegitimately. However, as fraud detection systems improved, offenders displaced to other methods, including compromised loyalty point accounts, phishing, and compromised business accounts.

"10807","Interpersonal Violence Prevention and Response on College and University Campuses: Opportunities For Faculty Leadership","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>Over the past decade, considerable and increasing attention has been paid to the high prevalence of sexual and intimate partner violence, stalking, and sexual harassment (i.e., interpersonal violence) on college and university campuses. Consequences of these victimizations are vast and long-lasting. Given the potential impact of dynamic changes in federal guidance on how to address interpersonal violence on campuses, it is even more critical for faculty from many different disciplines focused on anti-violence research and practice to be involved in efforts to intervene with and prevent such violence. In this commentary, we outline opportunities for faculty leadership in the areas of research, teaching, and service based on available research in these areas as well as our collective experiences as members of academia (e.g., students, former students, faculty) and former intimate partner violence and sexual assault service providers. Additionally, we discuss challenges that may arise for faculty (e.g., fixed-term faculty, adjunct faculty, pre-tenure assistant professors, tenured professors) taking on such leadership opportunities, such as increased workload and emotional labor, and make recommendations to help mitigate these challenges.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-9968-1","2018-05-09 08:31:26","52","Journal of Family Violence"

                  <span>
                    <h3>Research Question</h3>
                    <p>Can a reliable measure of precise harm levels for the 100 most harmful and frequently occurring offences be developed in Western Australia (WA) based on analysis of actual court penalties for first-time offenders?</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Data</h3>
                    <p>Criminal and traffic court sentences in 2.2 million records over 6.5&nbsp;years were analysed to extract the number of days of imprisonment actually imposed in sentencing decisions for approximately 52,000 first-time offenders (see House <span>2017</span>).</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>Sentences for all first offenders in a sample of the 102 most common offence categories were analysed to compute for the median number of days of imprisonment to which each first offender was sentenced in each of the categories. Monetary penalties and conditional community sentences were converted to equivalent &lsquo;prison days&rsquo; and added to the computation of the median of days of imprisonment per offence category. The number of reported offences in WA in the study period for each of the 102 categories was then multiplied by the median prison days sentenced per category. The sum of the products of median prison days times offence count was then tallied across all offence categories to form a weighted index of crime harm, which we define as the Western Australian Crime Harm Index (WACHI). Applying a minimum requirement of at least five separate court cases for each crime category, a total of 88 offence categories survived the reliability threshold for inclusion in the index.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Findings</h3>
                    <p>The 88 offence categories in the WACHI contain both high-harm and high-volume offences, permitting 95% of all offences reported for over 5&nbsp;years to be assessed for WACHI scores. The counts for these offences moved in different directions from the WACHI total in two of the four year-to-year comparisons. Changes in WACHI were shown to have been highly sensitive to increased reporting of historical sex crimes, isolated in one district each of both Metropolitan Perth and one Regional centre.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>Carefully implemented use of the West Australian CHI could improve both public safety and policing by adding precision to resource allocation decisions, assessments of priorities and evaluations of policing initiatives. The WACHI would be even more reflective of the changing level of harm to victims if all crime trends were to be based on crimes that occurred in the year under analysis, with separate reporting of crimes that happened many years ago. With that key adjustment, police professionals, department of justice officials, citizens and local governments can use a WACHI to make better decisions about how to prioritise policing in a wide range of contexts.</p>

"10815","The Effects of Specialized Treatment on the Recidivism of Juvenile Sex Offenders: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Objectives</h3>
                    <p>Specialized treatment programs for juvenile sex offenders (JSOs) are commonly used in juvenile justice systems. Despite their popularity, the evidence base for the effectiveness of these specialized programs is limited in both scope and quality. This systematic review and meta-analysis updates previous meta-analyses while focusing on studies of relatively high methodological quality.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>A vigorous literature search guided by explicit inclusion criteria was conducted. Descriptive and statistical information for each eligible study was coded independently by two coders and disagreements resolved by consensus. Odds ratio effect sizes were computed for sexual recidivism and general recidivism outcomes. Mean effect sizes and their heterogeneity were examined with both fixed and random effects meta-analysis.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>Only eight eligible studies were located, seven of which were quasi-experiments. The mean effect size for the seven studies reporting sexual recidivism favored treatment but was not statistically significant (OR&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.74, 95% CI 0.40, 1.36). The mean effect size for general recidivism was significant and also favored treatment (OR&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.58, 95% CI 0.42, 0.81).</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>Remarkably little methodologically credible research has been conducted on specialized programs for JSOs despite their prevalence. The best available evidence does not support a confident conclusion that they are more effective for reducing sexual recidivism than general treatment as usual in juvenile justice systems. Future research should not only use randomized designs but should also distinguish generalist offenders who are at low risk of sexual recidivism from specialist offenders who are at higher risk of committing future sexual offenses.</p>

We examine whether there is differential reporting to two public agencies, and whether it varies by race/ethnicity and region. We also study predictors of indicating a maltreatment report as credible. Data on positive neonatal toxicology reports were obtained from the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) and the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS). Variation in reporting rates by race/ethnicity and region were compared with Pearson chi-square analysis. Multivariate logistic regression examined factors related to the likelihood of DCFS indicating a report as credible for maltreatment. IDPH recorded 1838 reports of substance-exposed newborn infants while DCFS only recorded 459 reports. There was a greater percentage of whites than blacks reported to DCFS as compared to those reported to IDPH (p&#8239;&amp;lt;&#8239;0.001). There was a greater percentage of whites than blacks found to be indicated by DCFS as compared to those reported to IDPH (p&#8239;&amp;lt;&#8239;0.001). Infants reported in rural areas were indicated less often (OR:0.34, 95% CI:0.17&ndash;0.67, p&#8239;=&#8239;0.002) than those from urban areas. In conclusion, there was variation in reporting patterns between the two agencies. To optimize health outcomes for substance-exposed newborn infants (SEIs), the law should be clarified to provide clear standards for reporting and managing SEIs. Clinicians should ensure they are acting within the confines of existing law, and should engage in an interprofessional process with a broad array of stakeholders to develop statewide drug testing and reporting protocols.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213418301728%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Ddecbe580212cdb0b9e7b4ab0a00502f9","2018-05-10 08:30:20","45","Child Abuse and Neglect"

We aimed to determine the acceptability of PredAHT to child protection professionals. We conducted qualitative semi-structured interviews with 56 participants: clinicians (25), child protection social workers (10), legal practitioners (9, including 4 judges), police officers (8), and pathologists (4), purposively sampled across southwest United Kingdom. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and imported into NVivo for thematic analysis (38% double-coded). We explored participants&rsquo; evaluations of PredAHT, their opinions about the optimal way to present the calculated probabilities, and their interpretation of probabilities in the context of suspected AHT. Clinicians, child protection social workers and police thought PredAHT would be beneficial as an objective adjunct to their professional judgment, to give them greater confidence in their decisions. Lawyers and pathologists appreciated its value for prompting multidisciplinary investigations, but were uncertain of its usefulness in court. Perceived disadvantages included: possible over-reliance and false reassurance from a low score. Interpretations regarding which percentages equate to &lsquo;low&rsquo;, &lsquo;medium&rsquo; or &lsquo;high&rsquo; likelihood of AHT varied; participants preferred a precise % probability over these general terms. Participants would use PredAHT with provisos: if they received multi-agency training to define accepted risk thresholds for consistent interpretation; with knowledge of its development; if it was accepted by colleagues. PredAHT may therefore increase professionals&rsquo; confidence in their decision-making when investigating suspected AHT, but may be of less value in court.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213418301820%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Ddbf73667a0d5e08d9d35a4f4e0532718","2018-05-10 08:30:20","64","Child Abuse and Neglect"

                  <p>In the past decade, the number of rural-to-urban migrant adolescents in urban China has soared. Official criminal justice statistics point to their higher level of deviance compared to urban adolescents. This study examines whether rural migrant children are more delinquent than their urban peers in the school sample. It provides explanations for the gap by linking Hirschi&rsquo;s social bond theory with the literature on migration in China. Moreover, it formally tests which elements of social bonds mediate the relationship between migrant status and delinquency. Based on a large-scale survey in Guangzhou involving 470 rural migrants and 838 urban junior high school students, our analysis shows that migrant adolescents engage in slightly more delinquent behavior and have weaker social bonds than local adolescents. Attachment to parents and school, commitment to education, and belief in law fully mediate the positive relationship between migration and delinquency. Such findings indicate that within China&rsquo;s dual urban&ndash;rural structure, rural-to-urban migration can increase these adolescents&rsquo; exposure to risk factors that undermine their social bonds to conventional society and thus lead to higher levels of delinquency.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11417-018-9267-z","2018-05-10 10:15:14","47","Asian Journal of Criminology"

                  <p>This study explores the evolution and predictors of the homicide rate in 81 Turkish provinces from 1997 to 2015. Using regression analysis, it is demonstrated that several socio-economic factors are significantly associated with the level of the homicide rate. Moreover, the effects of the socio-economic factors change when the breakdown of the homicide rate with respect to two key demographic factors, age and gender, are also incorporated into the analysis.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10610-018-9389-y","2018-05-10 16:30:53","34","European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research"

We argue that the research suggests that there are no genetic components of personality disorder and also that this disorder has been found to be equally distributed across racial/ethnic groups. Understanding why there appears to be a racial/ethnic personality disorder disparity within the criminal justice system may be more a function of social class and historical circumstance than genetic composition.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0047235217303720%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D839d8d58049f4acd935047aad18279ab","2018-05-10 18:16:58","66","Journal of Criminal Justice"

                  <p>Risk terrain modelling (RTM) is emerging as an effective approach for predicting how and where crimes concentrate within cities and regions. However, in its previous applications there is a tendency to overestimate the influence of external environmental risks and preventive factors. Most studies applying RTM have investigated factors associated with the characteristics of the urban setting, whilst only a limited number have focused on identifying the risks associated with the availability and the characteristics of potential targets for criminals. This study uses RTM to identify the spatial risk and protective factors related to residential burglaries in the city of Milan, Italy. Factors considered are the neighbourhood- and target-related contextual factors, the exposure to crime and potential mitigating strategies. The results show that when the place and target of the offence are intrinsically related a target-oriented approach to select factors is useful for increasing the understanding of why some locations are most likely to experience future crimes. Indeed, the peculiarities of the target itself are integral to understan both the decision-making of criminals and the overall level of crime risk. Related policy implications are discussed.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10610-018-9385-2","2018-05-11 02:30:54","87","European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research"

Participants were children and adolescents with clinic-referred externalizing problems (N&#8239;=&#8239;282; 87.6% boys), aged 7&ndash;16 years. Mild and severe parental physical aggression was found to be uniquely associated with children&rsquo;s proactive aggression, whereas parental psychological aggression was uniquely associated with both proactive and reactive aggression. Consistent with previous evidence regarding CU traits as moderators of the relationship between negative parenting and child conduct problems, physically aggressive parenting was found to be more strongly associated with children&rsquo;s proactive aggression among children with low levels of CU traits, than those with high CU traits. These findings support the need for ongoing research into CU traits in Asian cultures, focused on heterogeneous risk pathways to antisocial behavior and individual differences in response to family-based interventions.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213418301868%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D3494c2c6c4577a1f32aab8080ea2e564","2018-05-11 08:30:23","94","Child Abuse and Neglect"

                  <p>Mention Nigeria to most people in the world and the retort is likely to be some reference to how corrupt the country is. Institutions, rules, and norms of behaviour have adapted toward the ultimate goal of predatory gain. When corruption becomes institutionalised in a society, it infiltrates the value-system, and it becomes a norm, part and parcel of culture. Nonetheless, one complicating and seemingly contradictory factor in this notion of the culture of corruption is that the majority of people in Nigeria do not internalise corruption as something morally acceptable. On the contrary, even if they have to take part in corrupt practices to get by or even to survive, they usually consider the practices as morally wrong. This work identifies, discusses, and analyses the weakness of institutions and the use and abuse of cultural norms as the primary reasons for endemic corruption in Nigeria.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10611-018-9779-6","2018-05-12 03:15:28","53","Crime, Law and Social Change"

                  <span>
                    <h3>Objective</h3>
                    <p>This article reports the findings of a quasi-experimental evaluation of the impact of residential halfway houses (HHs) on public safety in the immediate vicinity of the facilities.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>Instead of focusing on recidivism reduction or cost effectiveness, as is common, outcome measures for this study are limited to the impact on community crime rates, here defined as offenses committed within 1/8 and 1/4&nbsp;mi radii around a subject facility. A set of fixed effect Poisson regression models were employed to assess the changes in monthly crime counts associated with the opening or closing of an HH (<em>N</em>&nbsp;=&thinsp;19). A second difference-in-differences analysis (DiD) compares HHs that ceased operation to HHs that remained consistently open for the duration of the study period. A series of robustness checks were conducted.</p>

                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>We find the presence of an active HH is associated with an increase in crime within the immediate vicinity. We identify significant increases in monthly counts of overall crimes reported to law enforcement, as well as in counts for specific crimes of violence, including assaults and robberies with a firearm; property offenses, such as burglary; and in minor and misdemeanor offenses. A closing of an HH is associated with a decrease in reported crimes.</p>

                    <p>The location of a community-based correctional facility can have a significant and negative impact on public health, largely through decreased levels of local public safety. Evaluations of residential correctional programs should include indicators of community-level impact in addition to individual-level measures of recidivism, particularly when such programs are clustered in at-risk or vulnerable communities.</p>

The knowledge of how clinical, worker, and organizational characteristics interact with this decision to provide ongoing child welfare services is not well integrated in the research literature. Using secondary data from the Canadian Incidence Study of Reported Child Abuse and Neglect-2008, this study&rsquo;s primary objective is to understand the relationship of clinical, worker, and organizational characteristics to the decision to transfer a case to ongoing child welfare services and their relative contribution to the transfer decision in Canada. Findings indicate that several clinical level variables are associated with families receiving ongoing services. Additionally, organizational factors, such as type of services offered by the organization and the number of employee support programs available to workers, significantly predicted the decision to transfer a case to ongoing services. While no worker factors, such as education, amount of training, experience, or caseload, were associated with ongoing service receipt, the intraclass correlation coefficient of the final three-level parsimonious model indicated substantial clustering at the worker level. Results indicate that Canadian child welfare workers make decisions differently based on factors not available in the current study and that what would be deemed as important worker characteristics do not necessarily predict this outcome.

This paper reports a feasibility study into the effectiveness of a range of fingermark visualisation processes in developing fingermarks on clean metals (brass, bronze and stainless steel), and on the same metals after prolonged exposure to an outdoor environment. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to investigate how the surface type and condition could influence the development of fingermarks for each of the processes used. It was found that the behaviour observed varied between each of the processes (cyanoacrylate fuming, Lumicyano&trade;, gun blueing and carbon-based powder suspension). In some cases the chemical composition of the surface affected the development of the mark more than the surface condition, and in other cases the reverse was true. The best performing processes differed according to the surface type and condition, with cyanoacrylate fuming processes working best on brass and bronze, and powder suspensions being better on stainless steel. These preliminary results reinforce the need to take into account both surface type and condition before selection of the most effective fingermark visualisation process and demonstrate the value of techniques such as SEM in developing a fundamental understanding of the interactions between fingermarks and surfaces.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS1355030618301436%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Db2ef027bb75537dc165bc69f66b07b9b","2018-05-12 20:17:12","52","Science and Justice"

During two home visits mothers and fathers were observed with their children (age 1.5&ndash;6.0 years), filled in questionnaires, and completed the Parental Attributions of Child behavior Task (PACT; a computerized attribution task). Similar to our previous study, negative parental attributions mediated the relation between parenting stress and self-reported harsh and abusive parenting for both mothers and fathers. For mothers, this mediation effect was also found in the relation between parenting stress and lower levels of observed supportive parenting in a challenging disciplinary task. In addition, the relation of partner-related stress and abuse risk with harsh, abusive, and (low) supportive parenting were also mediated by maternal negative attributions. When parenting stress, partner-related stress, and abuse risk were studied in one model, only parenting stress remained significant.

"10871","Officersâ€™ Views on Women in Policing","Policing: An International Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine how receptive police officers are to having women as partners and supervisors at work in a cross-national context. Specifically, it compares male and female police officersâ€™ views on women in policing along three dimensions in Dubai and Taipei: perceived efficacy of women in policing; receptiveness of women at work (as partners and supervisor); and perceived womenâ€™s role in police work.   Design/methodology/approach Surveys (with the same instrument) were conducted with 622 officers (344 male and 278 female officers) in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates and 391 officers (297 male and 94 female officers) in Taipei, Taiwan. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were employed to compare male and female officersâ€™ views on women in policing in both countries.   Findings It was found that female officers (in Dubai and Taipei) were more likely than their male colleagues to see women as capable and effective in performing police duties. Compared to their colleagues in Taiwan, the Emirati male and female officers were more likely to be supportive of womenâ€™s restricted role in policing. Dubai male officers were less likely to be receptive to working at a unit with a female as their supervisor in comparison to their female colleagues in both countries.   Research limitations/implications Although this study provides important information from a cross-national perspective, caution should be taken while interpreting these findings. The gender roles embedded in Islamic cultures seem to explain Dubai officersâ€™ favorable attitudes toward womenâ€™s restricted role in policing. Future studies should incorporate in-depth interviews to explain why officers in Dubai prefer womenâ€™s restricted roles in policing.   Practical implications The statistical analyses show that officers with higher levels of confidence not only held more positive attitudes toward women in policing, but also were more receptive to having women as their partners and supervisors. It suggests that confident officers would be more open-minded and welcome the entry of women into police work. By offering training courses that enhance officersâ€™ work confidence, police organizations in both countries might well cultivate a welcoming work environment for women.   Social implications If police organizations in Taiwan and the UAE instill cultures with an emphasis less on masculine traits than on collaborative style, male officers might free themselves from traditional gender norms and become more welcoming to women who work in policing.   Originality/value Previous scholarly efforts on examining different areas of women in policing have mainly focused on police officers in western countries, leaving a relative scarcity of information about how officers perceive womenâ€™s role in policing in the other parts of the globe. Female officers have to work hand in hand with male officers in policing. To enhance the efficiency of deployment and cohesion of work relationship among male and female officers, it is important to understand how male officers perceive womenâ€™s roles in policing and how receptive they are to having women as partners. Understanding their perceptions from both sides can help administrations initiate effective training and educational programs.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-12-2016-0174?af=R","2018-05-14 11:47:17","109","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

"10879","Procedural Justice Training For Police Recruits: Results of A Randomized Controlled Trial","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Objectives</h3>
                    <p>Procedural justice training for police officers is designed to improve officers&rsquo; interactions with the public. Aside from the fact that it is a given that citizens deserve to be treated in a fair manner by authorities such as the police, it is expected, based on the literature, that if the police act in a procedurally just manner they will be seen as more legitimate and citizens will subsequently be more willing to cooperate or comply with them. The present study was designed to evaluate the impact of a specifically designed procedural justice knowledge and skills-based training program on newly recruited police officers&rsquo; attitudes and interactions with the public.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>Fifty-six police recruits were matched into pairs with one officer from each pair randomly selected to participate in a short procedural justice training program at the end of their recruit training period. In addition to being surveyed about procedural justice-related attitudes, recruits&rsquo; interactions with the public as newly inducted first year police officers were evaluated in real-time by their field training mentors in relation to procedurally just behaviors.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>Results suggest some limited positive effects of the training on both officer attitudes and actual on-the-job behavior. Mentors&rsquo; ratings of procedurally just behaviors in public interactions were generally higher for experimental than control recruits. Furthermore, recruits&rsquo; perceptions of the effectiveness of procedural justice were increased immediately after the training, though not their perceived use of these skills. However, these effects were not always statistically significant.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>This study adds to the evidence surrounding procedural justice training of police officers, indicating that such training programs are feasible and have the potential to improve officers&rsquo; interactions with members of the public.</p>

Using a sample of 2488 Structured Decision Making<sup loc=""post"">&reg;</sup> assessments administered in San Francisco county from 2011 to 2015, we identified a profile of safety threats that accounts for why workers are more likely to determine children of parents with mental illness and/or substance abuse unsafe in the home. Eight percent of assessments in our sample involved parents with current mental illness only and 10% had comorbid substance abuse. The odds of an unsafe determination more than doubled among parents with mental illness (<italic>OR&#8239;</italic>=&#8239;2.52, <italic>p&#8239;</italic>&amp;lt;&#8239;0.001) and were nearly tenfold higher among parents with comorbid substance abuse (<italic>OR&#8239;</italic>=&#8239;9.62, <italic>p&#8239;</italic>&amp;lt;&#8239;0.001). Three safety threats accounted for all of the effect of parental mental illness on safety determination: caretaking impairment due to emotional stability/developmental status/cognitive deficiency (57%), failure to meet a child&rsquo;s immediate needs (30%), and threats of harm (14%). Three safety threats accounted for 55% of the effect of comorbid mental illness and substance abuse on safety determination: failure to meet a child&rsquo;s immediate needs (21%), presence of a drug-exposed infant (21%), and caretaking impairment due to emotional stability/developmental status/cognitive deficiency (14%).

In addition, parental reflective functioning (PRF), a capacity underlying sensitive caregiving, is often low in mothers with SUD. This study examines the relationship between PRF and aversive (emotional, physical, sexual abuse and neglect) and adaptive (safety and competence) experiences, in different developmental phases (early childhood, latency, and adolescence) in mothers with a SUD. A sample of 43 mothers with small children were interviewed with the Parental Developmental Interview to assess PRF, and they completed the Traumatic Antecedents Questionnaire regarding aversive and adaptive experiences. In addition, we used the Hopkins Symptoms Checklist-10 to control for mental health status and a battery of neuropsychological tests to control for executive functions. Results indicated that adaptive experiences in early childhood were positively related to PRF, and that experience of emotional abuse was negatively related to PRF. When separating the group of mothers in two sub-groups based on PRF level, results showed that mothers with negative to low PRF had significantly more experiences of adversities in early childhood and latency, and significantly less adaptive experiences in early childhood, latency and adolescence, compared to mothers with moderate to high PRF.

                  <span>
                    <h3>Objectives</h3>
                    <p>This short report tests whether altering messages concerning the presentation (i.e., criminal justice actor experience vs. summary of scientific findings) or nature of criminological research findings (i.e., lack of crime control effect vs. collateral consequences) regarding the (in)efficacy of sex offender residence restrictions (SORR) would subsequently affect public support for this policy.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>The experimental conditions were presented in a factorial survey delivered to a national online panel, which was subsequently matched to a sampling frame representative of US adults on the basis of gender, age, race, education, ideology, and political interest (<em>N</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;970). Analysis of variance was used to estimate the impact of the experimental manipulations on SORR opposition.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>Support for SORR was high across all experimental conditions, and no manipulations were statistically associated with variation in opposition to the policy.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>The results support limited previous research suggesting that the public would continue to support SORR even in the lack of evidence to its effectiveness. This research suggests that altering the presenter or nature of research evidence subsequently produces no opinion change, at least in the form that was executed here. Further research on the mechanisms underlying the recalcitrance of SORR support is necessary.</p>

"10898","Cyber-Organised Crime. A Case of Moral Panic?","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>A growing number of studies show that the advent of the Internet has transformed the organisational life of crime, with many academic and non-academic articles and reports describing various types of organisational structures involved in cybercrimes as &ldquo;organised crime&rdquo;. Other researchers are more critical in applying the organised crime label to cybercrimes. These debates are not merely speculative and scholastic but have a real practical significance, as over-estimating organised crime involvement can attract more resources (which might end up being allocated in a less efficient way), additional legal powers, and support from the general public. This study aims to further this path of inquiry by investigating whether the advancement of the cyber-organised crime narrative in the UK can be identified also in the media discourse. More specifically, this study will analyse UK press to explore to what extent &ldquo;moral panic&rdquo; can be identified, how primary definers use particular tactics and rhetorical constructions, and what are the dominant consequences.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12117-018-9342-y","2018-05-16 07:32:52","127","Trends in Organized Crime"

However, the robustness of this association and the direction of the link between maltreatment and ADHD remain unclear. We used data from the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, a cohort of 2232 British twins, to investigate the associations between exposure to abuse/neglect and ADHD in childhood and in young adulthood, and to test their robustness and specificity. We also aimed to test longitudinal associations between abuse/neglect and ADHD from childhood to young adulthood, controlling for confounders. Results indicated strong associations between abuse/neglect and ADHD in childhood and also in young adulthood. In childhood, the association was concentrated among children with comorbid conduct disorder. Longitudinal analyses showed that childhood ADHD predicted abuse/neglect in later years. This association was again concentrated among individuals with comorbid conduct disorder. Abuse/neglect in childhood was not associated with later ADHD in young adulthood after adjusting for childhood ADHD. Our study does not provide support of a causal link between child abuse/neglect and adult ADHD but highlights the possibility of a long-term effect of disruptive behaviors on the risk for experiencing abuse/neglect. These findings emphasize the need for clinicians treating people with ADHD, especially those with comorbid conduct disorder, to be aware of their increased risk for experiencing abuse/neglect. Interventions aimed at reducing risks of abuse/neglect should also focus on the environment of individuals with disruptive behaviors.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213418301856%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D75a642e17c4eb465700b94ff8c4e5260","2018-05-16 22:46:06","61","Child Abuse and Neglect"

The aim of this study was to carry out an exploratory investigation of adolescents&rsquo; motives for selling sex in a population-based survey in Sweden. A total of 5839 adolescents from the third year of Swedish high school, mean age 18.0 years, participated in the study. The response rate was 59.7% and 51 students (0.9%) reported having sold sex. Exploratory factor analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis were used to identify groups of adolescents according to underlying motives for selling sex. Further analyses were carried out for characteristics of selling sex and risk factors. Three groups of adolescents were categorized according to their motives for selling sex: Adolescents reporting; 1) Emotional reasons, being at a greater risk of sexual abuse, using sex as a means of self-injury and having a non-heterosexual orientation. 2) Material but no Emotional reasons, who more often receive money as compensation and selling sex to a person over 25 years of age, and 3) Pleasure or no underlying motive for selling sex reported, who were mostly heterosexual males selling sex to a person under 25 years of age, the buyer was not known from the Internet, the reward was seldom money and this group was less exposed to penetrative sexual abuse or using sex as a means of self-injury.

"10907","The Impact of Cybercrime on Businesses: A Novel Conceptual Framework and Its Application to Belgium","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>Despite growing indications and fears about the impact of cybercrime, only few academic studies have so far been published on the topic to complement those published by consultancy firms, cybersecurity companies and private institutes. The review of all these studies shows that there is no consensus on how to define and measure cybercrime or its impact. Against this background, this article pursues two aims: 1) to develop a thorough conceptual framework to define and operationalize cybercrime affecting businesses as well as its impact, harms, and costs; and 2) to test this conceptual framework with a survey of businesses based in Belgium, which was administered in summer 2016 and elicited 310 valid responses. Consisting of five types, our conceptualization of cybercrime is, unlike others, technology-neutral and fully compatible with the legislation. Drawing on Greenfield and Paoli&rsquo;s Harm Assessment Framework (<em>The British Journal of Criminology</em>, 53, 864&ndash;885, <span>2013</span>), we understand impact as the overall harm of cybercrime, that is, the &ldquo;sum&rdquo; of the harms to material support, or costs, and the harms to other interest dimensions i.e., functional (or operational) integrity, reputation and privacy. Whereas we ask respondents to provide a monetary estimate of the costs, respondents are invited to rate the severity of the harms on the basis of an ordinal scale. We claim that this &ldquo;double track&rdquo; gives a fuller, more valid assessment of cybercrime impact. Whereas most affected businesses do not report major costs or harm, 15% to 20% of them rate the harms to their internal operational activities as serious or more, with cyber extortion regarded as most harmful.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10611-018-9774-y","2018-05-16 22:46:14","25","Crime, Law and Social Change"

                  <p>In Denmark, Finland, and Sweden, offenders sentenced to life can be released conditionally from prison. Once they have served a legally specified minimum term behind bars, a court decides whether they qualify for release. Through comparative legal research, interviews with criminal justice professionals, and a questionnaire administered to those involved in the decision-making process, this study compares and contrasts how the release process functions in these three countries. Particular attention is paid to the nature of decision makers, the criteria they use to grant or deny release, and the amount of discretion they have in the release decision. The findings suggest that the release process exemplifies the traditionally strong role that judges have played in penal decision making in Scandinavia. The amount of discretion appears to be strongest in Finland and weakest in Sweden, where judges have increasingly been challenged to balance retributive against reintegrative goals of punishment in the release decision.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10610-018-9388-z","2018-05-16 22:46:37","58","European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research"

                  <p>Despite increased recognition that childhood animal cruelty (CAC) is a risk factor for subsequent interpersonal violence, there is a dearth of research examining motivations for children&rsquo;s animal cruelty behaviors in the context of violent households. The purpose of this study is to build on prior research in this area using a qualitative child-centered design to explore themes in children&rsquo;s narratives about harming animals. We were specifically interested in learning: (1) what contextual or situational factors are related to CAC behaviors in the context of adverse family settings? (2) what do children&rsquo;s accounts of their behaviors reveal about their beliefs about animal minds?, and (3) what are motivations for children&rsquo;s perpetration of harm against animals? Forty-six children and their maternal caregivers were recruited from community-based domestic violence services. Children were asked to describe times when they had harmed animals; caregivers were interviewed separately about children&rsquo;s harm to pets, and these data were used to triangulate patterns in the child data. Data were analyzed in Atlas.ti using the qualitative coding process of template analysis. Our thematic findings included: history of witnessing animal cruelty; history of witnessing pet neglect/abandonment; CAC with family members; minimization of animal harm; anthropomorphic beliefs about animal sentience; punishing pets out of anger; and curiosity. Our findings demonstrate that asking about children&rsquo;s experiences with animals is an important part of the evaluation process for professionals who encounter children exposed to, or at risk for, experiencing family violence. Implications for research and intervention efforts are discussed.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-9970-7","2018-05-17 00:31:29","40","Journal of Family Violence"

                  <p>This study examines the association between state laws that prohibit firearm ownership for offenders convicted of misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence (MCDV) and firearm ownership in two-parent families with high-conflict male partners with arrest histories. Mixed effects logistic regression models applied to data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth cohort (<em>n&thinsp;=</em>&nbsp;5350) determined that living in a state with laws that prohibited firearm ownership for convicted MCDV offenders decreased the likelihood of firearm ownership among families with high-conflict males by 62%. The length of the time limit on firearm prohibition was correlated with incremental decreases in firearm ownership in such families, with the probability of firearm ownership among families with high-conflict males decreasing from 30% in states with no MCDV laws restricting access from firearms to 12% in states with permanent prohibition on firearm ownership. These findings have significance for public health policy aimed at decreasing intimate-partner homicide.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-9966-3","2018-05-17 04:16:56","59","Journal of Family Violence"

This narrative contribution reviews research assessing the efficacy of neurobiological interventions and the usability of neurobiological predictors of treatment outcome in the treatment of antisocial behavior, particularly in juveniles. Several neurobiological interventions and predictors that may contribute to behavioral improvement are discussed. The application of individually tailored cost and time effective neurobiological methods of high quality is advocated, while ensuring minimal stigmatization and limiting the invasiveness of the intervention for the individual.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0047235218301351%26_version%3D1%26md5%3De383d56ffdec4f2e8651a7022c996406","2018-05-17 18:31:50","68","Journal of Criminal Justice"

Despite this known vulnerability, research on the subject has lagged. The current study sought to analyze CPWs&rsquo; experiences with client violence, their interpretation of it, its perceived consequences and their coping strategies. Specifically, 30 CPWs working both in the community and in residential settings, took part in an in-depth, semi-structured interview. A thematic analysis revealed that CPWs view client violence as a recurring and pervasive problem in their line of work. Residential workers described a greater frequency of violence, especially physical violence. CPWs however perceived violence differently, with some viewing this problem as &lsquo;part-of-the-job&rsquo; while others described client violence as a &lsquo;call-for-help&rsquo; on behalf of clients. Perceived consequences varied in severity and breath. CPWs reported consequences at the psychological (e.g. fear, hypervilence, sadness, nightmares), organizational (e.g. loss of motivation, turnover intention, sick leaves) and clinical levels (e.g. emotional detachment from clients, avoiding clients). CPWs also described numerous coping strategies, some effective while others appeared short-sighted. This study concludes with recommendations with regards to client violence in child protection work.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS014521341830187X%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Dc9c81e34311e1862c23bf9ba66684730","2018-05-17 22:45:33","90","Child Abuse and Neglect"

                  <p>Through participatory observation and in-depth interviews with thirty-four practitioners, this article pierces the veil of the dynamics of China&rsquo;s pretrial detention system by looking into various socio-legal factors which may affect law enforcement in China. When the prosecutors make their decisions on detention in practice, a variety of factors such as state compensation, performance-based evaluation as well as judicial ecology such as public opinion, power struggle, and judicial coordination all play a role. The dynamics of China&rsquo;s detention system, through governing the prosecutors&rsquo; daily operations and the procuratorate&rsquo;s routine policy-making, often distort the pretrial detention system that is mainly regulated by the Criminal Procedure Law and in practice, result in a high rate of custody. The dynamics also suggest a non-autonomous criminal justice system in China, meaning that extra-legal factors usually influence, complicate, and sometimes even re-direct China&rsquo;s development of the rule of law.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10611-018-9782-y","2018-05-18 21:45:28","27","Crime, Law and Social Change"

"10949","Consumer Involvement in Japanese Pornography Production","<p>The authors examined two pornographic film series produced in Japan in the first decade of the twenty-first century, as well as their DVD box cover advertising copy. Additionally, and crucially, these data were examined in light of online forum posts made by the producers and consumers of the two film series before, during and after their production. These posts indicate consumer-producer cooperation and collaboration in all aspects of the series&rsquo; planning and execution, in addition to consumer involvement in the perpetration of the filmed sex acts and abuses themselves. The discussion of the article emphasizes the accelerating effect of online collaboration between pornographic film producers and consumers regarding the severity of harms then visited upon female victims. It was noted that these victims are most often women in the sex industry. The article further highlights the (consumer) demand-pull effect that online forums have on the production and dissemination of pornography, in contrast to (producer) supply-push effects that have been emphasized in other feminist anti-pornography research.</p>","http://digitalcommons.uri.edu/dignity/vol3/iss2/9","2018-05-19 15:30:52","49","Dignity: A Journal on Sexual Exploitation and Violence"

Yet, despite the contribution of small businesses, previous researchers have overlooked the fraud issues that are threating the sustainability of those businesses and instead focus mainly on large and public listed companies. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to identify how small businesses can prevent fraudulent activities.  Design/methodology/approach This study used self-administer questioners and distributed 126 questionnaires to general managers, financial managers and supervisors in Malaysian small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Multiple regression was used to test the theoretical model.  Findings The output of multiple regressions showed that culture of honesty and high integrity, anti-fraud processes and controls and appropriate oversight functions has a positive and significant effective on fraud prevention mechanisms.  Practical implications Overall, this study suggests effective fraud prevention measures to mitigate the fraud risk surrounding Malaysian SMEs and other SMEs in emerging countries.  Originality/value There has been a dearth of empirical studies on the effect of culture of honesty, anti-fraud processes and appropriate oversight functions on effective fraud prevention in non-western context, and this study has fulfilled the need for this research.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-05-2017-0049?af=R","2018-05-21 13:46:27","39","Journal of Financial Crime"

Findings There are some attempts to combat financial crimes in Indonesia, both internally and externally. The attempts that have been made for the internal scope are the enactment of anti-money laundering law, the new monitoring system of financial institutions and the formation of a superintendent institution. The attempts that have been made for the external scope are the agreement between Indonesiaâ€™ financial intelligence unit Pusat Pelaporan dan Analisis Transaksi Keuangan (PPATK), and other countriesâ€™s financial intelligence unit, the affiliation member of the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG) to combat financial crimes through strengthening its anti-money laundering and terror financing capabilities.

"10962","Backdating of Executive Stock Options: Comparing Financial and Nonfinancial Industries","Journal of Financial Crime, Volume 25, Issue 2, Page 518-526, May 2018. &lt;br/&gt; Purpose The 2008-2009 subprime mortgage crisis in the USA caused bankruptcies and closures of many financial institutions. Yet many CEOs of US financial institutions were awarded huge bonuses and pay packages despite the economic collapse, suggesting that their incomes were not in conjunction with those of the shareholders, indicating a serious agency problem. This issue raises the question as to whether stock option backdating, another example of an agency problem, was as prevalent as slack lending policies among these financial institutions. This paper aims to compare the relative magnitude of executive option backdating in financial and nonfinancial firms.  Design/methodology/approach Using a sample of CEO stock option grants from 1995 to 2006, obtained from ExecuComp, the authors employ an event study around the grant dates of executive options. The authors compare the abnormal price movements between financial and nonfinancial firms.  Findings The abnormal negative stock returns were found before the award dates for both groups of firms. The after-event abnormal returns of both groups of firms, however, show different trends. For nonfinancial firms, there is an immediate turnaround of the abnormal return movement right after the grants; that is, the price increases, indicating the occurrence of significant backdating events. For financial firms, however, there is no significant price rebound after the grant date. In fact, the price continued to decline throughout the after-event period.  Research limitations/implications The result shows that nonfinancial firms demonstrate significantly more option backdating behavior than financial firms.  Practical implications The findings suggest that previous findings on prevalent backdating among all public listed firms are only partially correct. This paper shows that backdating behavior found in previous studies is indeed driven by nonfinancial firms. This unexpected finding contradicts the initial prediction of authors that option backdating may be more likely among financial firms.  Originality/value Based on previous research, the authors recognize that generally the official grant dates of firms must have been set retroactively, as shown by Lie (2005). The findings, however, show that financial firms demonstrate only partial backdating behavior. This study opens a path for future research to further discover why financial firms exhibit less backdating behavior compared with nonfinancial firms, and if option backdating is not an issue for financial firms, why the share prices of these firms decline significantly prior to the grant date.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-01-2017-0001?af=R","2018-05-21 13:46:27","79","Journal of Financial Crime"
"10963","Asset Misappropriation in Small Businesses","Journal of Financial Crime, Volume 25, Issue 2, Page 369-383, May 2018. &lt;br/&gt; Purpose This paper aims to increase the understanding of the types of insider financial frauds that occur within small businesses by focusing on a sample of businesses that have not employed a certified fraud examiner (CFE) in response to employee theft.  Design/methodology/approach The survey data analyzed come from 102 small businesses (100 employees or fewer) in a midsized Midwestern city in the USA, and reflect 125 reported employee thefts.  Findings The study results indicate that small businesses that do not hire a CFE report certain thefts with greater and lower frequencies as compared to small businesses that do hire a CFE. For particular types of frauds, CFEs may be no more useful than the efforts of business owners or managers, and other employees.  Practical implications There may be important organizational differences between businesses that hire CFEs and those that do not, differences related to the ways in which business finances are maintained, the ways in which specific controls are used and the ability of employees to access business resources. These factors may create business-based opportunity structures that make particular types of insider financial frauds more or less likely to occur within a particular business.  Originality/value Existing research on insider financial frauds may not appropriately account for small businesses that cannot afford, or are unwilling, to hire a CFE. The findings discussed in this paper contribute to a more complete picture of the types of frauds that small businesses experience, as well as how these businesses deal with insider theft.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-01-2017-0004?af=R","2018-05-21 13:46:27","47","Journal of Financial Crime"
"10964","Regulating Virtual Currencies â€“ the Challenges of Applying Fiat Currency Laws to Digital Technology Services","Journal of Financial Crime, Volume 25, Issue 2, Page 562-575, May 2018. &lt;br/&gt; Purpose The purpose of this paper is to consider the recent (Dec`15) introduction of the Bitlicensing rules in New York and consider from a banking perspective how this will impact on their own risk assessment processes. The paper also outlines the challenges of applying financial regulation to companies that have an area of expertise and business that is more aligned to software development, rather than financial service provision.  Design/methodology/approach This paper is a viewpoint paper, which offers a critical discussion on the FATF guidelines on virtual currencies. The paper compares developments that are currently occurring within the virtual currency sector in particularly the new Bitlicensing process in New York State and discusses the implications to the banking sector on risk assessment processes for virtual currency transactions.  Findings This paper will benefit the banking and regulation industries as well as economic and banking academics and anyone with an interest in virtual and digital currency technology.  Originality/value This paper is unique in that it examines the issue of virtual currency regulation from a banking perspective. It explains the virtual currency technology as a means to be enhancing banking risk assessment, for clients seeking to incorporate virtual currency transactions into their business. This paper impacts on the banking and regulatory sectors because it critically examines the current practice of over regulation and the impact that this has on alternative financial systems, such as digital and virtual currencies. The paper offers a theoretical framework as well as citing current practical reports of how regulation has already started to affect the financial services landscape. The impact of getting this wrong can lead to increased criminal activity, and this paper highlights how susceptible the financial sector is to this.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-08-2016-0055?af=R","2018-05-21 13:46:27","35","Journal of Financial Crime"
"10965","Borderless Crimes and Digital Forensic: Nigerian Perspectives","Journal of Financial Crime, Volume 25, Issue 2, Page 619-631, May 2018. &lt;br/&gt; Purpose This paper aims to determine the extent to which the myriad of cybercrimes is within the purview of extant Nigerian laws against the backdrop of the modicum of legal and institutional mechanisms available at international law for combating cybercrimes.  Design/methodology/approach This study is library based. It relies on secondary data generated by the variegated multilateral agencies, law reports of international and municipal tribunals, relevant books, journals, monographs policy papers and so forth as the basis of analysis.  Findings Findings suggest that cybercrimes are very difficult to unravel because their traces are imperceptible and require highly specialised skills and digital protocols to find, store and save them for evidential purposes. Such gathered evidence are in the form of digital data stored in variegated hardware and software media, such as storage peripherals, electronic components, working memory, hard discs and external discs. The difficulty is how to identify, weigh for evidential value and capture the multiplicity of evidence unearthed in a digital forensic investigation. The foregoing underscores the digital forensic problematic which is engendered by the difficulties of contriving a thoroughgoing concept of digital evidence given the malleable nature of the variegated storage media.  Practical implications This paper engenders considerable acquaintance of the entire sphere of digital crimes and cyber threats, which is contended with in the information epoch, and recommends both legal and institutional mechanisms to counter the clear, real and present danger, which digital crimes represent for the survival of human civilisation, sustainable economic growth and development.  Originality/value This paper dwells on the infinite potentiality of deploying the instrumentality of national and international law to deter, control and prosecute the myriad of cybercrimes.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-12-2016-0079?af=R","2018-05-21 13:46:27","46","Journal of Financial Crime"

"10979","Police Corruption: A Comparison Between China and India","Journal of Financial Crime, Volume 25, Issue 2, Page 248-276, May 2018. &lt;br/&gt; Purpose There is no comparative research into the Chinese (PSB) police and the Indian police generally and none on police corruption in particular. This paper aims to show what police corruption and malpractices look like in China and India and offer up some suggestions as to why wide spread malpractices persists.  Design/methodology/approach Horsesâ€™ mouth qualitative research is supported by primary public and police survey data.  Findings There are many similarities in corruption â€œtricks of the tradeâ€ in both the countries, as well as in the reasons for its persistence. However, petty police corruption is more pervasive and less subtle in India. But both the forces suffer from politicization of policing, criminalization of politics, culture of tolerance towards substantive justice over procedural justice and master/servant attitude towards the public. In China, the police have administrative powers beyond criminal legislation, and Indian corruption is underscored by the culture of â€œJugaadâ€.  Research limitations/implications This is largely a qualitative research, so the usual arguments regarding limitations on its generalization applies. However, the insights in this article may provide some understanding of this under-researched topic and may stimulate further research in this field. It may also offer pointers to potential solutions for practitioners and policymakers.  Practical implications By providing data on what corruption looks like and why it persists, policymakers can use the findings of this study to develop measures to address them. In so doing they would create a police service in India and China that is less prone to corruption and misconduct, thereby increasing public trust in these institutions.  Social implications Peace and security is a prerequisite condition for economic and social modernization through the rule of law. Reform of the police is a critical success factor in this process. Therefore, by reforming the police, India and China stand a better chance of eradicating poverty and reducing inequality.  Originality/value There is little in the way of research into the Chinese Police and none into Chinese police corruption. There is also no comparative study of the Chinese and Indian police generally and none on police corruption in particular.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-10-2017-0096?af=R","2018-05-22 14:46:37","52","Journal of Financial Crime"
"10980","Tackling Fraud Effectively in Central Government Departments","Journal of Financial Crime, Volume 25, Issue 2, Page 384-399, May 2018. &lt;br/&gt; Purpose Fraud has a significant effect on society. It has been estimated to cost the UK economy more than Â£50bn annually. The Government have signalled their determination to tackle these losses through a range of preventative, enforcement and collaborative activities. Diminishing police resources allocated to fraud means that this activity will need to be delivered by both law enforcement and civilian counter fraud teams. This paper aims to establish whether UK central government organisations have the legal powers, skills and regulation needed to tackle fraud effectively.  Design/methodology/approach This research was based upon a literature review, which included academic and other material, a semi-structured interview programme and a survey of counter fraud champions.  Findings Empirical data suggested that the effectiveness of central government civilian counter fraud teams is hampered by a fragmented legal landscape and a lack of skills, and that further professionalisation and regulation is needed to protect professional standards and individual legal rights.  Research limitations/implications Postal survey had 50 per cent response rate â€“ below gold standard of 70 per cent.  Practical implications There are no practical implications, as this is a topical research area which is intended to inform counter fraud practice and development.  Social implications This research highlights limitations on the UK central governmentâ€™s ability to tackle fraud. There is therefore a low risk that, when published, this research could inform those considering fraudulent actions.  Originality/value This research was undertaken for a professional doctorate and has been sent to the Cabinet Office to inform their professionalisation programme. It filled a potential gap in the academic literature by looking at the perceived powers, skills and regulatory pressures in place within the UK central government and the extent of the current gap between current practice and the delivery of a fully professionalised service.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-01-2017-0006?af=R","2018-05-22 14:46:37","84","Journal of Financial Crime"

Design/methodology/approach Case laws and legislations are examined as are relevant reports by regulators.  Findings Singaporeâ€™s anti-money laundering (AML) regimes may not act as an effective deterrent against money laundering activities within financial institutions. This is due to the overreliance on the theory of deterrence-based thinking, the lack of an â€œenforcement pyramidâ€ and economic factors which influence regulators to be lenient towards financial institutions.  Research limitations/implications There are limited data available in relation to regulators in Singapore and the prevalence of money laundering activities within Singaporeâ€™s financial institution. Any discussions within this article is based on the impressionistic observations of this author, which may not reflect the true state of affairs in Singapore.  Practical implications Those who are interested in examining the relationship between money laundering and the deterrent effect of sanctions against financial institutions will have an interest in this topic.  Originality/value The value of the paper is to demonstrate that Singaporeâ€™s AML regimes may not act as an effective deterrence against money laundering activities within financial institutions.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-01-2018-0001?af=R","2018-05-22 14:46:37","56","Journal of Financial Crime"
"10982","Fraud Prevention Initiatives in the Nigerian Public Sector","Journal of Financial Crime, Volume 25, Issue 2, Page 527-544, May 2018. &lt;br/&gt; Purpose Detecting and preventing fraud are challenging and risky tasks, especially in a fast developing economy such as Nigeria. The efforts become crucial in the government sectors, as they involve publicâ€™s trust and resources. The purpose of this study is to examine the relationships between the fraud incidence and the elements of fraud triangle theory (FTT) with the aim of combating current fraud outrages in the Nigerian public sector.  Design/methodology/approach A survey was conducted and 302 questionnaires were distributed to the staff of the departments of accounting, internal auditing and investigation of ten selected ministries, departments and agencies of Kano State, Nigeria. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to analyze the data.  Findings The study reveals a significant relationship between three elements of FTT and fraud incidences in the Nigerian public sectors (p-value &lt; 0.001 for pressure and opportunity and p-value = 0.024 for rationalization).  Practical implications The findings of the study are useful for forensic accountants and the Nigerian anti-graft bodies to enhance existing control mechanisms in fraud prevention initiatives. The research also contributes to bridge the gap in academic theory and empirical study related to FTT.  Social implications Fraud scandals can cause publicâ€™s frustration, damage the reputation and integrity of the ruling government and result in negative image of the public sector.  Originality/value Accordingly, the study suggests a salary scale reform (SSR) in the Nigerian public sector and improvement in fringe benefits to increase employeesâ€™ standard of living. The study concludes with recommendations to enhance fraud awareness and training programs to the government employees.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-02-2015-0008?af=R","2018-05-22 14:46:37","48","Journal of Financial Crime"

I Have An Idea!!","Journal of Financial Crime, Volume 25, Issue 2, Page 589-597, May 2018. &lt;br/&gt; Purpose The paper aims to explore the present cheque clearance system in the USA and its possible misuses in the practical sense. Cheque kiting has been a way of creating fictitious cash balances on the balance sheet, which is a fraud. This practice can be prevented by a different accounting treatment.  Design/methodology/approach The paper compares the cheque clearance system in the USA with the authorâ€™s own experiences from Turkey. It purports the riskiness of the present cheque clearance system on the financial statements and suggests a practical accounting application to prevent possible financial statement misrepresentations.  Findings The paper explores that if the present accounting treatment is changed both for the banks and the businesses, the possibility of cheque kiting and misrepresentation of cash balances on the balance sheet will end. Basically, cash is the amount that can be used by the customer, the rest is not cash, it is â€œcheques in collectionâ€ and it should be treated as an account receivable until it is collected.  Practical implications Financial statements are vital for the business world. Based on these statements, banks lend money, governments collect taxes and people buy and sell stocks. They need to be presented fairly. The present accounting application on cheque clearance is not transparent enough in the USA, and this might lead to misrepresentation of financial statements. The paper suggests a practical solution to this problem. By changing the accounting treatment, the companies will only show cash in their cash accounts and not the cheques in the collection process.  Social implications Fair treatment is the motto for any situation we face in our daily lives. One may be a poor or rich person but the treatment should be fair unless he/she is a fraudster. A rich personâ€™s cheque is deposited in his/her bank account the next business day, and a poor personâ€™s cheque might take days to be credited. This is not a fair treatment. The paper suggests that there must be a one-way accounting treatment, regardless of the depositorâ€™s financial situation.  Originality/value This paper has been prepared based on the authorâ€™s past business experience in Turkey and his study of the US cheque clearance system, comparing the two. It reflects the real-world examples of cheque kiting and its negative consequences in the USA and proposes a solution.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-05-2017-0036?af=R","2018-05-22 14:46:37","51","Journal of Financial Crime"
"10984","Greed of the Elite; Capital Flight From A Fragile Country: Case of Burundi","Journal of Financial Crime, Volume 25, Issue 2, Page 598-618, May 2018. &lt;br/&gt; Purpose This study aims to undertake an institutional analysis of capital flight and examine the drivers of capital flight from Burundi.  Design/methodology/approach Given the episodes of political instability and poor governance which have characterized Burundiâ€™s landscape in the past decades, coupled with macroeconomic instability which has been prevailing, political, economic and institutional factors are used to explain the trend and magnitude of capital flight which were recorded. An econometric analysis using robust least squares is also used to examine the determinants of capital flight from Burundi.  Findings The estimation results seem to be sensitive to capital flight measurement used, but in general, they suggest that external debt, political instability and wars, as well as exports, are the main drivers of capital flight from Burundi.  Research limitations/implications The findings of this study imply that to discourage capital flight, the government of Burundi should promote peace and political stability. In addition, more responsibility, more transparency and accountability are required from the government of Burundi in managing resources from external debt. Moreover, some actions are needed to fight trade misinvoicing, which was seen to be a major channel of capital flight from Burundi. It is however to be acknowledged that our econometric analysis results might not be robust because of data limitations related to data availability on capital flight for only the period 1985-2013.  Originality/value This study contributes to the existing capital flight literature in two ways. First, by undertaking the first ever country-specific study focusing on Burundi, and second, by undertaking an institutional analysis of capital flight to understand the political, economic and institutional issues behind capital flight from Burundi. The focus in this study is on Burundi because of the burden that capital flight imposes on the country already impoverished.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-11-2016-0075?af=R","2018-05-22 14:46:37","61","Journal of Financial Crime"
"10985","Inventory Control Weaknesses â€“ A Case Study of Lubricant Manufacturing Company","Journal of Financial Crime, Volume 25, Issue 2, Page 436-449, May 2018. &lt;br/&gt; Purpose For a manufacturing company, inventory control and management is crucial to ensure smooth production and sustainable sales performance, as well as preventing stockout that will result in customer switch to competitors. This paper aims to examine the effectiveness of cycle count activities, one of the inventory control tools to manage inventory. Beside, this study also wishes to identify any loopholes in practices and procedures in inventory control of companies.  Design/methodology/approach One of the lubricant manufacturing companies in Malaysia was selected as a case study and mixed method data collection of document analysis and observation were used. The analysis and examination was conducted by using Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission Framework 2013 as guidance.  Findings This study found that problems in inventory control can be caused by inconsistency of practices due to incomplete or absent standard operating procedures. Furthermore, no segregation of duties and excessive reliance on one person to conduct many tasks will lead to human error and fraud.  Research limitations/implications This paper enhances the theoretical understanding on the inventory control and management system applied in the manufacturing organization particularly. However, frequent changes of the management in the organization of the case study make the study difficult to obtain consistent information. Not all standard operating procedures were revised or updated and available for examination. In addition, some of the reports needed for investigation are confidential and requests to observe and scrutinize information from those documents are denied by the company. Thus, more in-depth analysis and verification on the issues of interest were unable to be conducted.  Practical implications This study provides an indicator that cycle count activities need to be conducted frequently on a regular basis so that the physical inventory and recording system are accurate. Cycle count activities also must involves various related departments in the company in which regular training is essential to ensure employees are aware and understand their responsibility and accountability on the inventory.  Originality/value This study is original as it focuses on the inventory control management of one of the largest lubricant manufacturing in Malaysia, particularly on cycle count activities which is scare in literature. Furthermore, the company allows research access to the documents and operations conducted in the company, which is usually difficult to obtain from many companies.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-11-2016-0077?af=R","2018-05-22 14:46:37","56","Journal of Financial Crime"
"10986","A Public Perception Study on Bribery As A Crime in Turkey","Journal of Financial Crime, Volume 25, Issue 2, Page 337-353, May 2018. &lt;br/&gt; Purpose The purpose of this study is to explore the perception of Turkish citizens of the severity of bribery relative to other crimes and violations.  Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire survey was administered to 545 Turkish people respondents. A five-point Likert scale that measures attitudes and behaviors using answer choices was used to categorize the degree of seriousness of each crime for data analysis.  Findings The results of the study show that bribery ranked 16th among the 33 offences surveyed, that is, it lies in the middle in terms of seriousness. The results also indicate that the average person views bribery as not a very serious crime. When compared to violent crimes, bribery is significantly less serious. As for the property crimes, bribery is significantly less serious than arson and carjacking, but it significantly more serious than damage to public property, shoplifting and bike theft. When compared to white-collar crimes, bribery is remarkably less serious than embezzlement and appreciably more serious than welfare fraud, insider trading, child labor, minimum wage and insurance fraud. The results of this study are substantial; general public do not perceive bribe as a serious crime.  Originality/value This is an important study in relation to Turkey. This is as a pioneer study that indicates the relationship between bribery as a crime and other offences in Turkey. The results of this study should be useful to policy-makers in Turkey and elsewhere. Another important sight of this study is the fact that the results show different correlations with similar studies put through in the other countries. According to the studies, bribery was the least serious crime in Australia and New Zealand; it ranked in the middle in terms of seriousness in Mexico, similar to Turkey; and it was also less serious than the average offense in the USA.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-07-2017-0061?af=R","2018-05-22 14:46:37","74","Journal of Financial Crime"
"10987","Nigerian Corruption Complex: Rethinking Complementarities to Curative Measures","Journal of Financial Crime, Volume 25, Issue 2, Page 576-588, May 2018. &lt;br/&gt; Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the emerging corruption complex in Nigeria, the cultural nexus that influence its enculturation, dynamics and the amoral values that tend to shape it.  Design/methodology/approach The paper drew data largely from documentary and empirical secondary sources for analysis.  Findings Current institutional responses are not effective and cannot be sustainable in the fight against corruption. The enculturation process needs to be countered through measures other than arrest, prosecution and punishment to include mass mobilisation, values orientation, conscientisation and sensitisation of Nigerians on the evils of corruption.  Research limitations/implications The endemicity of corruption in Nigeria suggests the multiplicity of its causative factors. But this study focuses only on primordial cultural fault line which hinders collective conscience in the fight against corruption.  Practical implications Implementing the suggestions on moral awakening â€“ value orientation, conscientisation, mass mobilisation and sensitisation â€“ is thought of as enthronement of national values as opposed to primordial ethnic cultural values. It would complement the legal remedies in the fight against corruption.  Social implications The building of character of Nigerians alongside existing laws on corruption will checkmate emerging culture of corruption that is attracting adherents in both business and bureaucratic activities in the countries.  Originality/value The paper takes a cultural perspective and explains how primordial cultural values inhibit natural cultural values to enthrone amoral values that have contributed to the emergence corruption complex in Nigeria.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-12-2016-0082?af=R","2018-05-22 14:46:37","92","Journal of Financial Crime"
"10988","Adequacy of Law Enforcement and Prosecution of Economic Crimes in South Africa","Journal of Financial Crime, Volume 25, Issue 2, Page 450-466, May 2018. &lt;br/&gt; Purpose Economic crime is a serious challenge to business leaders, government officials and private individuals in South Africa. Given the important role of law enforcement, prosecution and sentencing in deterring economic crimes, the purpose of this paper is to determine if law enforcement, prosecution and sentencing practices are deemed to be adequate in South Africa.  Design/methodology/approach Primary data from Web-based and manual questionnaires were used to empirically analyse the perceptions of sentenced economic crime offenders and role-players regarding the statement that law enforcement and prosecution practices of economic crimes relating to fraud, corruption or tax evasion in South Africa are not adequate. The final realised sample included a total of 345 from the various populations of key role-players and a total of 82 economic crime offenders from a Gauteng-based correctional institution. Mannâ€“Whitney U tests were used to test for significant differences between the views of role-players and economic crime offenders.  Findings The majority of both groups of respondents is of the opinion that law enforcement, prosecution and sentencing practices in South Africa are not adequate with regard to economic crime offences, although statistically significant differences exist in the degree of agreement. The challenge is therefore to prosecute more economic crime offenders by improving law enforcement, prosecution and sentencing practices. The study also revealed that people have a reluctance to speak out about fraud, corruption or tax evasion or to report such offences for various reasons.  Originality/value The research assisted in identifying the challenges economic crime presents and the shortcomings in current law enforcement, prosecution and sentencing practices in South Africa.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-12-2016-0081?af=R","2018-05-22 14:46:37","44","Journal of Financial Crime"

Ml=bs and Aml= Bs2","Journal of Financial Crime, Volume 25, Issue 2, Page 294-308, May 2018. &lt;br/&gt; Purpose The purpose of this paper is to advance debate and prompt new strategies substantially to improve the capacity to disrupt serious profit-motivated crime.  Design/methodology/approach Using interdiction rates (the proportion of criminal funds seized or forfeited) as an interim proxy effectiveness indicator, this article challenges elements of the dominant anti-money laundering/counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) narrative, and reflects on policy effectiveness and outcomes.  Findings Interdiction rates in jurisdictions surveyed hardly constitute a rounding error in the accounts of profit motivated criminal enterprises. The current AML/CFT model appears almost completely ineffective in disrupting illicit finances and serious crime.  Research limitations/implications With such research at an early stage, some data are poorly substantiated and methodological inconsistencies rife.  Practical implications For policy interventions with a reasonable prospect for crime not to pay, beyond rhetoric, frank evaluation of results and a potential step-change in policy, regulatory and enforcement vision and capability, may be required.  Originality/value Scholars have exposed a paucity of meaningful links between AML/CFT controls and crime and terrorism prevention, yet the dominant narrative persists largely unchecked. This paper examines components of that narrative in the context of scholarship on â€œbullshitâ€.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-08-2017-0071?af=R","2018-05-22 14:46:37","60","Journal of Financial Crime"
"10990","The Creation of Express, Resulting and Constructive Trust in Banking Transactions","Journal of Financial Crime, Volume 25, Issue 2, Page 277-286, May 2018. &lt;br/&gt; Purpose This paper aims to analyse the circumstances where an express, resulting or constructive trust may arise in banking transactions, taking in consideration relevant case law. Bankers in certain situations could become a trustee or a fiduciary in relation to their customers. Emphasis is given on the issue of constructive trust as, after many years of inconsistent case law, a recent decision of the Supreme Court clarifies this controversial issue.  Design/methodology/approach The paper is focused primarily on examining relevant cases and judicial reasoning to identify the circumstances leading to the creation of express, resulting or constructive trust in banking transactions.  Findings In certain circumstances, the banker could become liable as a trustee under equity. An express trust may arise between a banker and a customer in cases where the customer gives the money to the bank to fulfil a specific purpose. Where the bank is not able to fulfil this purpose, a resulting trust may arise and will hold the money as a resulting trustee. There are some exceptional situations, where the bank can be liable as a constructive trustee. An agent who receives benefits in breach of his fiduciary duty holds those benefits on trust for his principal.  Practical implications Knowledge of the legal position and the circumstances that can lead to the creation of express, resulting or constructive trust is essential for both bankers and their clients to protect their interests. The flexibility of equitable remedies can be used to fill in the gaps or deficiencies in the common law. Clients of banks or even third parties in the case of constructive trust can be in a very advantageous position in circumstances where a trust for their money is created.  Originality/value The paper takes in to consideration all updated academic papers and modern court decisions. The analysis provided in the paper can be very useful for bankers, their clients and practitioners. The paper clarifies the application of equity law and the creation of trust in certain banking transactions.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-08-2017-0073?af=R","2018-05-22 14:46:37","55","Journal of Financial Crime"
"10991","Impact of Fraud on Ghanaian Smes and Coping Mechanisms","Journal of Financial Crime, Volume 25, Issue 2, Page 400-418, May 2018. &lt;br/&gt; Purpose Small and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs) are the engine of growth of most developing countries, as they employ a large number of people as opposed to large firms. Consequently, these enterprises should succeed in expanding to become significant employers and producers. However, what seems obvious at least through cursory observation is that the current state of SMEs betrays an economic loss with respect to the benefits that ought to be forthcoming from their potential. This loss can be triggered by a number of factors. The study determines the drivers of internal fraud and their impact on Ghanaian SMEs and prescribes coping mechanisms.  Design/methodology/approach Primary data collected on 250 SMEs collected from various sectors across Accra, the capital of Ghana, are used for this study. Using a cross-sectional regression, the authors identify the key drivers of internal fraud that hamper the growth of Ghanaian SMEs.  Findings The regression results show that although several fraud variables impact negatively the growth of the SME sector, it is only accounting fraud which is significant. This study also revealed that stealing, fake currency issued for the payment of goods or service and non-payment of goods or service account for almost 83 per cent of fraud cases experienced by SMEs.  Research limitations/implications The study was limited to the SMEs located in the Accra, the capital of Ghana.  Practical implications The study will offer SMEs owners methods that will assist in their determination to fight fraud in the business that they manage.  Social implications The survival of SMEs is paramount to job creation. Consequently, combating fraud that stifle the growth of SMEs will allow SMEs to grow to their full potential and create more job opportunities for the unemployed. This will minimizes the social vices such as robbery, stealing, drug trafficking and prostitution that confront nations.  Originality/value This study should be useful to managers of SMEs, auditors and the security agencies in developing economies in particular, in their quest to combat fraud within SMEs.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-05-2017-0050?af=R","2018-05-22 14:46:37","72","Journal of Financial Crime"

Design/methodology/approach Based upon a qualitative content analysis of 15 informal interviews with providers of illegal financial services and 15 formal interviews with compliance experts and law enforcement officers, the general suitability of hawala networks for the financing of terrorism was assessed and concrete methods of doing so were better understood. In addition, it is shown how terrorists can limit their risks in using the services of hawala bankers.  Findings Hawala banking in Switzerland is extraordinarily useful for the financing of terrorism.  Research limitations/implications The findings are based on semi-standardized interviews limited to the perspectives of the 30 interviewees.  Practical implications Law enforcement and intelligence agencies must be provided with additional tools, such as a broader scope of allowable activity for undercover police officers and the possibility of secretly conducting remote online searches of electronic devices. While this article focuses on Switzerland, its findings could be applied on a global level.  Originality/value While the existing literature focuses on understanding the channels terrorists can use to finance their activities and on developing prevention mechanisms, this paper describes exactly how terrorism can be financed through hawala networks in Switzerland.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-06-2017-0056?af=R","2018-05-22 14:46:37","83","Journal of Financial Crime"
"10993","Combatting Organised Crime and Terrorism in Central Asia","Journal of Financial Crime, Volume 25, Issue 2, Page 309-319, May 2018. &lt;br/&gt; Purpose This paper aims to examine the shift away from the traditional distinction between organised crime and terrorist groups towards their conceptual convergence under the crime-terror nexus narrative in the context of international security and development policy in post-Soviet Central Asia. It assesses the empirical basis for the crime-terror and state-crime nexus in three Central Asian countries â€“ Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan â€“ and argues that the exclusion of the state from the analytical framework undermines the relevance of the crime-terror paradigm for policy-making.  Design/methodology/approach This paper draws on a literature review of academic research, recent case studies highlighting new empirical evidence in Central Asia and international policy publications.  Findings There is a weak empirical connection between organised crime and Islamic extremists, such as the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan and Hizbut Tahrir, in Central Asia. The state-crime paradigm, including concepts of criminal capture, criminal sovereignty and criminal penetration, hold more explanatory power for international policy in Central Asia. The crime-terror paradigm has resulted in a narrow and ineffective security-oriented law enforcement approach to counter-narcotics and counter-terrorism but does not address the underlying weak state governance structures and political grievances that motivate organised crime and terrorist groups respectively.  Originality/value International policy and scholarship is currently focussed on the areas of convergence between organised crime and terrorist groups. This paper highlights the continued relevance of the traditional conceptual separation of terrorist and organised crime groups based on their different motives, methods and relationship with the state, for security and democratic governance initiatives in the under-researched Central Asian region.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-07-2017-0069?af=R","2018-05-22 14:46:37","65","Journal of Financial Crime"

Design/methodology/approach Defining corruption is a universal challenge. Thus, in reviewing Zimbabwes definition, this paper also draws on other common law system jurisdictions based on English traditions and Sharia law to make a comparative analysis. The paper also takes a multi-disciplinary approach that transcend fields of law and anthropology.  Findings Although criminal law can be used as the normative basis in the fight against corruption, it can also be used by the powerful to shield themselves from corruption, through its indeterminacy and interpretation. Be this as it may, real and firm law can assist in curbing the vice.  Research limitations/implications The paperâ€™s purview is limited both in terms of subject and scope. Although it starts by considering the definition of corruption to get a broad overview of this subject, it mainly focuses on the meaning of two popular concepts that are popularly identified with our understanding of corruption â€“ abuse of power and public office.  Originality/value The paper tries to establish a framework for understanding and curbing corruption through the use of statutory law.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-06-2017-0055?af=R","2018-05-22 14:46:37","53","Journal of Financial Crime"

This purpose of this study is to expand this literature with a social capital analysis of a criminal network. The focus of the analysis will be the recent egregious investment fraud of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities (BLMIS).  Design/methodology/approach This research involves a case study of the BLMIS financial fraud. The article uses a social capital theoretical lens, with archival sources taken from the court records of Madoff v. NY to include victim impact statements and the defendantâ€™s Plea Allocution.  Findings Financial crime literature can be expanded with a social capital analysis which facilitates a socio-economic analysis of ego-centric criminal networks.  Research limitations/implications Each financial crime is of its time; however, there are recurring socio-economic network characteristics that could be applied to develop an understanding of criminal networks.  Practical implications Any understanding of financial crime, including contemporary instances of criminal innovation, such as cyber-crime, can be enhanced with a social capital analysis of criminal networks.  Originality/value A social capital analysis of financial crime draws attention to â€œhuman factorsâ€ in criminal networks that are integral to this form of crime.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-06-2017-0057?af=R","2018-05-22 14:46:37","110","Journal of Financial Crime"
"10996","A Model For Preventing Corruption","Journal of Financial Crime, Volume 25, Issue 2, Page 545-561, May 2018. &lt;br/&gt; Purpose This paper aims to investigate the extent of corruption globally, explains its social and economic consequences and introduces a model, composed of corporate governance mechanisms, internal controls and red flag analyses, which organizations can apply to prevent corruption.  Design/methodology/approach This study uses criminology theories to analyze corruption and its prevention.  Findings The global cost of bribery alone is estimated at US$1tn annually, not including costs resulting from non-completion and deficient completion of development projects (World Bank Institute, 2004). This paper shows that an effective prevention model should include a positive work environment and ethical governance; the implementation of a compliance risk management program with fraud risk assessments; an accessible psychological assistance program for employees; regular employee anti-fraud training; the implementation of targeted internal controls such as proper segregation of organizational duties; the adoption of fair compensation levels and realistic individual performance goals; a user-friendly and anonymous reporting mechanism; and independent and regular analyses of abnormal patterns (red flags).  Research limitations/implications This paper extends previous research by tying together disparate factors into a cohesive model for the prevention of corruption.  Practical implications The prevention model developed in this paper assists in deterring corruption, improving internal controls, improving the likelihood of detection and reducing opportunities to perpetrate corruption. By reducing the risk of corruption, this model also helps organizations and governments reduce project costs (public spending) and improve project quality, thus promoting economic competitiveness.

"10997","Bitcoin Money Laundering: Mixed Results?","Journal of Financial Crime, Volume 25, Issue 2, Page 419-435, May 2018. &lt;br/&gt; Purpose This paper aims to shed light into money laundering using bitcoin. Digital payment methods are increasingly used by criminals to launder money obtained through cybercrime. As many forms of cybercrime are motivated by profit, a solid cash-out strategy is required to ensure that crime proceeds end up with the criminals themselves without an incriminating money trail. The authors examine how cybercrime proceeds can be laundered using services that are offered on the Dark Web.  Design/methodology/approach Focusing on service-percentages and reputation-mechanisms in underground bitcoin laundering services, this paper presents the results of a cash-out experiment in which five mixing and five exchange services are included.  Findings Some of the examined services provide an excellent, professional and well-reviewed service at competitive cost. Whereas others turned out to be scams, accepting bitcoin but returning nothing in return.  Practical implications The authors discuss what these findings mean to law enforcement, and how bitcoin laundering chains could be disrupted.  Originality/value These cash-out strategies are increasingly facilitated by cryptocurrencies, mainly bitcoin. Bitcoins are already relatively anonymous, but with the rise of specialised bitcoin money laundering services on the Dark Web, laundering money in the form of bitcoins becomes available to a wider audience.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-11-2016-0067?af=R","2018-05-22 14:46:37","119","Journal of Financial Crime"

"11000","Predicting Property Crime Risk: An Application of Risk Terrain Modeling in Vancouver, Canada","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>Research on the spatial dimension of crime has developed significantly over the past few decades. An important aspect of this research is the visualization of this dimension and its underlying risk across space. However, most methods of such visualization, and subsequent analyses, only consider crime data or, perhaps, a population at risk in a crime rate. Risk terrain modeling (RTM) provides an alternative to such methods and can incorporate the entire environmental backcloth, data permitting. To date, the RTM literature has dominantly focused on violent crime in the United States. In this paper, we apply RTM to property crime victimization (residential burglary) in Vancouver, Canada. We are able to show that not only does RTM have applicability in a Canadian context but provides insight into nonviolent victimization.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10610-018-9386-1","2018-05-23 04:15:55","54","European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research"

                    <p>Whether people are affected by the criminal behavior of peers (the &ldquo;influence&rdquo; perspective) or simply prefer to associate with others who are similar in their offending (the &ldquo;selection&rdquo; perspective) is a long-standing criminological debate. The relatively recent development of stochastic actor-oriented models (SAOMs&mdash;also called SIENA models) for longitudinal social network data has allowed for the examination of selection and influence effects in more comprehensive ways than was previously possible.

                  <p>While discussion on corruption in sport is intensifying and football match-fixing in particular is attracting increasing attention, new fixing scandals emerge offering new accounts of actors and corrupt practices within the football industry and the level of the external threat to the sport. The scandal exposure of fixed matches in Turkey in 2011 sheds light on the fixing of 17 matches played in the 2010/11 football season and allowed for insights to the actors, structure and processes behind the fix. Following four criminal and seven disciplinary proceedings, the case is still pending appeal for its final decision, involving a total of 93 suspects and having already resulted in the exclusion of two teams from European competitions. The evidence collected by the authorities points towards a hierarchical criminal organisation led by the President of a football club that arranged and coordinated the fixing in order for his team to win the national Championship. The aim of this article is to provide an account of the organisation and coordination of match-fixing in Turkey, with its actors, specifics and criminal characteristics, while offering an examination of match-fixing for sporting success, the least documented type of match-fixing.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12117-018-9345-8","2018-05-23 22:32:14","52","Trends in Organized Crime"

Juxtaposing these two literature that have been rarely linked in empirical research, the present study examines a hypothesis in the field of criminology that self-control interacts with pubertal timing in the creation of violent acts among adolescent girls. Using a cross-sectional sample of South Korean girls, the results of the analysis support the working hypothesis that girls' violent acts are amplified by the combination of low self-control and early pubertal development.

                  <p>Crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED) is practiced by various professions and agencies in many jurisdictions. The role police play in CPTED has received limited scrutiny from academics within Australia (and other countries). This article makes an important contribution to addressing this gap in the literature through providing New South Wales Police Force Crime Prevention Officers (CPOs) perspectives on their role in reviewing council development applications from a CPTED perspective. Findings show police-council relations vary considerably. Some police-council areas have clear policies in place to enable police to contribute to reviewing crime risks of development applications, whilst others do not. Many police feel their engagement in the planning and development process is often tokenistic, receiving limited feedback from councils about their recommendations. For these police, they see little ongoing relevance of reviewing development applications. If police are to remain involved, there is a need to develop clearer parameters of how police will contribute and what they can realistically be expected to contribute to this process.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1057/s41300-018-0043-x","2018-05-24 11:15:27","91","Crime Prevention and Community Safety"

                  <p>The transition to fatherhood can be a time of stress and excitement for expectant and new fathers. At the same time, the impact of men&rsquo;s use of intimate partner violence (IPV) during and following pregnancy on women is well documented. Currently, a lack of programmatic efforts to engage men during the transition to fatherhood to interrupt IPV exists. This study sought to illuminate the perceptions of men, who had recently become fathers and had perpetrated IPV, about the idea of a transition to fatherhood program, for men like themselves. The thirteen study participants universally favored the idea of and need for such a program. Findings also described participants&rsquo; identified timing, format, and topics, which could inform future development of transition to fatherhood program for men who have perpetrated IPV. Policy and practice implications for social service and health care providers include implementing pre- and post-natal screening of men.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-9969-0","2018-05-24 16:16:19","43","Journal of Family Violence"

After approximately 60&#8239;years, the identification of the remaining unidentified twelve victims began with anthropological and genetic analysis carried out by a team of Italian forensic experts. Anthropological analysis was performed in field in order to confirm the sex of each victim and verify the presence of only one individual in each grave for a correct sampling. Selected bone fragments for each individual were then collected and transferred to the laboratory for genetic analysis. Although the anthropological ante mortem information was limited, morphological and metrical data was collected for a possible future identification of the victims. Subsequently, the typing of autosomal loci, Y-STR and mtDNA D-loop region of all bone and available reference samples was conducted. LR and cumulative LRs obtained from autosomal STR and Y-STR results confirmed the alleged relationship between three victims and their relatives with values over 10<sup loc=""post"">4</sup> (one sample) and 10<sup loc=""post"">6</sup> (two samples).

However, research on female psychopathy has increased over the past twenty years, and we are gaining more information about the similarities and differences in psychopathy in males and females. The purpose of this systematic review is to discuss the current research on gender differences in the correlates of psychopathy. The research to date largely relies on measures based on the Psychopathy-Checklist-Revised and includes studies examining various types of emotional and cognitive processes, as well as moral judgment, a construct involving both emotional and cognitive processing. Research suggests that both males and females higher in psychopathy show similar deficits in emotional modulation of the startle reflex, but females do not display some of the emotional processing deficits to the same extent as males higher in psychopathy. Because of limited research, it is less clear if there are gender differences in the relationship between psychopathy and cognitive processes. Females with psychopathic traits have not been found to demonstrate response perseveration or passive avoidance errors, but the relationship between psychopathy and other cognitive processes such as error processing seems to be similar in males and females. There also may be differences in how males and females higher in psychopathy process moral information, including how they respond to unfairness and moral violations. More studies directly comparing males and females within the same sample are needed to further examine gender differences in the correlates of psychopathy.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS1359178918300284%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D088fb8561a835bb6785b26881cf9dce9","2018-05-24 23:45:11","42","Aggression and Violent Behavior"

However, to date, little research has been conducted concerning what occurs during criminal investigations of HT. The present study, through interviewing 21 highly experienced and senior professionals from law enforcement agencies and governmental bodies in the UK, conceptualizes HT investigations under a common framework that underpins a model for the investigation of these crimes. Data from these narratives reveals that a total number of 22 investigative actions are commonly taken throughout the investigative process, following an apparent sequential route. While participants disagreed as to when/how to initiate and conclude an investigation, absolute agreement existed when considering multi-agency collaboration, tactical advice and support, and intelligence sharing (as core elements in HT criminal investigations). Such data enables both academic and practitioner communities to better identify what are effective investigation actions when these crimes are investigated.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay031/5004309?rss=1","2018-05-25 11:02:21","63","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"

                  <p>Awareness-raising tactics are arguably the first priority in the prevention strategies in Vietnam at present. Awareness-raising campaigns are implemented through two kinds of communication methods: community-based activities and mass media. Although anti-trafficking activities in Vietnam have achieved some successful results, recent evidence suggests that a lack of clear progress in the areas of trafficking awareness-raising still remains. The quality and extent of collaboration between authorised agencies are key factors in anti-trafficking activities, including raising awareness on human trafficking. However, to date, there has been no systematic research on inter-agency cooperation in awareness-raising activities in Vietnam. This paper first reviews the nature of human trafficking and legal framework on raising trafficking awareness in Vietnam. The paper then presents successes and challenges of current inter-agency collaborative activities undertaken to implement the awareness-raising strategies.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11417-018-9269-x","2018-05-25 21:15:15","32","Asian Journal of Criminology"

                  <p>This article evaluates the effects of violence related to the operations of drug-trafficking organizations (DTOs) on electoral competition, defined by the number of electoral alternatives or candidates in Mexico&rsquo;s municipal elections. I find that the killing and threatening of politicians, which are effective tools to influence politics, jeopardizes competition in violent Mexican municipalities by reducing the number of candidates. This result is not only probabilistically robust but also meaningful. The number of candidates can fall to one in the more violent municipalities. However, DTOs can also provide (illegal) funding to politicians to facilitate their candidacies. I find that as confrontation intensifies among DTOs, the negative effect of violence on electoral competition moderates. This finding suggests that DTOs finance candidates to capture municipal governments when facing intense competition and attacks from other DTOs. In addition, DTOs in this context may also provide protection to their preferred candidates from other competing organizations. These factors temper the negative effect of violence on electoral competition.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12117-018-9344-9","2018-05-25 22:47:02","30","Trends in Organized Crime"

                  <p>Since the 1960s, the application of psychological services and research to law enforcement settings (known as &ldquo;police psychology&rdquo;) evolved from being practically nonexistent to almost universal in a relatively short period of time (Scrivner <span>2006</span>). Currently, psychologists provide a variety of services to law enforcement agencies, including performing evaluations for pre-employment selection, &ldquo;fitness-for-duty&rdquo; evaluations (FFDE), and counseling/treatment for psychologically troubled officers and first responders. The extensive use of personality assessment instruments in police psychology is not surprising given the fact psychologists have traditionally concerned themselves with issues of psychological measurement and test construction. In the contemporary practice of police psychology, assessment using personality measures is essential, being utilized in all of the abovementioned evaluations, in addition to other occasional applications (Weiss et al. <span>2008</span>). This article provides a brief history of personality assessment in police and public safety psychology as it developed from 1916 to 2008.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9272-2","2018-05-26 08:16:38","112","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"

The first research question asked whether physical abuse victimization at the hands of parents/guardians, bullying victimization at the hands of peers, and the abuse x bullying interaction encouraged early involvement in substance misuse. The second research question inquired as to whether the victimization&#8210;substance misuse relationship was mediated by variables proposed by various theories and research studies&mdash;specifically, cognitive impulsivity, negative affect, and low self-esteem. A moderated mediation hypothesis was tested in a group of 865 (417 boys, 448 girls) schoolchildren from the Illinois Study of Bullying and Sexual Violence who were 10 to 15 years of age at the time of initial contact. A path analysis performed with three waves of data revealed that physical abuse and bullying victimization predicted substance misuse with mediation by cognitive impulsivity, but there was no evidence of moderation. On the basis of these results, it was concluded that victimization, whether through parental physical abuse or peer bullying, increases cognitive impulsivity, and that cognitive impulsivity, in turn, encourages early involvement in substance misuse. The practical implications of these results are that interventions designed to counter cognitive impulsivity and encourage cognitive control may be effective in preventing children traumatized by physical abuse and bullying from entering the early stages of a drug or substance using lifestyle.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213418302023%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D0bc442a4b021607848d9adbf3910be66","2018-05-27 00:00:24","45","Child Abuse and Neglect"

Data are from 126,868 students in the 8th, 9th, and 11th grades who participated in the 2016 Minnesota Student Survey, an anonymous, self-report questionnaire examining youth behaviors, experiences, and perceptions. Logistic regression models were used to determine if 10 types of ACEs, including abuse, household dysfunction, and food and housing insecurity were associated with receipt of recommended preventive medical and dental care after adjustment for demographic covariates and self-reported health. ACEs scores were entered into regression models to test for cumulative impact of adversities on preventive care outcomes. More than one third (38.5%) of youth identified at least one ACE, most commonly having a parent or guardian who had ever been in jail or prison. Each type of ACE was significantly associated with reduced odds of receiving preventive care in the last year. Associations with food insecurity were of greatest magnitude, associated with 0.32 [CI: 0.64&ndash;0.72] to 0.54 [CI: 0.44&ndash;0.49] decreased odds of receiving care. Each one point increase in the total ACE score was associated with 0.07 [CI: 0.92&ndash;0.94] to 0.15 [CI: 0.84&ndash;0.86] decreased odds of having had a preventive care visit in the last year.

High rates of posttraumatic stress have been observed in this population. However, there is currently no standard for the universal screening of children in child welfare for trauma exposure and traumatic stress. This study examined the trauma experiences of a sample of maltreated children and whether their child welfare workers were effective screeners of traumatic stress symptoms. Descriptive and correlational analyses were conducted regarding a sample of children (N&#8239;=&#8239;131) with trauma screenings completed by their child welfare workers and clinical measures of traumatic stress symptoms. Four hierarchical regression models were also examined to determine whether workers' screening information regarding child age, trauma exposure history and symptoms of traumatic stress were predictive of outcomes on clinical measures. The analyses revealed complex trauma exposure histories and high rates of traumatic stress symptoms among this generally younger sample of maltreated children. Additionally, the models supported workers' efficacy in screening for symptoms of total posttraumatic stress and specific trauma symptoms of intrusion and avoidance. Workers were less effective in screening for the symptoms of arousal. These findings support the importance of identifying the trauma recovery needs of maltreated children and the utility of child protection workers in assisting with the trauma screening process. Implications are provided for related practice, policy and training efforts in child welfare.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213418302059%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Dcb318e82032012b9b9b3bab33d821027","2018-05-27 00:00:24","49","Child Abuse and Neglect"

The investigators specifically queried the phenomenon of seeking healthcare services after foster care drawing from the Phenomenology of Practice approach. We interviewed 13 young adults who aged out of care. Investigators extracted lived experience descriptions (LEDs) from interview transcripts and analyzed under phenomenological themes.

                  <p>The losses caused by worker theft is one of the most concerning security problems for corporations. Private policing of the workplace is central to cutting down on such losses and keeping up profits. One of the most frequently used methods in such policing is searching workers. Despite the importance of searches and their potential for intrusion into individuals&rsquo; right to privacy, the normative bases for and limits to the use of this power have so far been little studied. The aim of this paper is to analyze the legal foundations and limits imposed by the Brazilian State so that private security guards can conduct searches in the workplace. The analysis is based on a qualitative study of Brazilian labor law and a qualitative/quantitative study of 376 judicial decisions on searches collected randomly in two Brazilian states between 2010 and 2013. The data shows that searches can be conducted in the workplace based on the employer&rsquo;s right to manage production and protect their property. It also indicates the existence of relatively flexible limits to searches. Only a minority of the courts impose restrictions on searches similar to those set for police officers. Most judges allow more extensive searches than those permitted within the scope of public justice systems. The consequences of these findings are discussed.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10611-018-9783-x","2018-05-27 01:30:29","46","Crime, Law and Social Change"

A prospective, longitudinal design was utilized to assess maternal physical and sexual betrayal trauma in relation to children&rsquo;s own maltreatment experiences, and child mood and behavioral symptoms during pre-adolescence. Data from 706 mothers and children who participated in the Longitudinal Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect (LONGSCAN) was analyzed, including: mothers&rsquo; physical and sexual maltreatment histories, child protective services&rsquo; documented physical and sexual maltreatment during children&rsquo;s first twelve years of life, and mother- and child-reports of child internalizing and externalizing symptoms at age 12. Children of mothers who survived high BT (maltreatment by a caregiver) were 4.52 times more likely to experience maltreatment than children of no BT mothers (mothers whom were not maltreated), and 1.58 times more likely than children whose mothers survived low BT (maltreatment by a non-caregiver). Higher levels of maternal physical BT significantly predicted more internalizing and externalizing symptoms in children at age 12, according to both mother (CBCL) and child (YSR) reports. More incidents of child physical maltreatment partially mediated associations between maternal physical BT and child symptoms. Incidents of sexual maltreatment also partially mediated associations between maternal sexual BT and child internalizing and externalizing symptoms (CBCL only). These findings have implications for understanding the role of betrayal trauma in perpetuating the cycle of maltreatment across generations.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213418302114%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Ddd0bbab45f46a00fe65aa7e5ecbb55c7","2018-05-28 00:00:21","58","Child Abuse and Neglect"

The sample included 5058 clinic-referred youth from the Core Dataset (CDS) of the National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN) with lifetime histories of exposure to one or more of three specific types of maltreatment: <italic>psychological maltreatment</italic> (PM), <italic>physical abuse (PA)</italic>, and <italic>sexual abuse (SA)</italic>. First, we examined variations in salient trauma characteristics (age of onset, duration of exposure, number of co-occurring trauma types, and perpetrator type and number) by maltreatment group. Second, we examined whether type of maltreatment remained associated with mental health measures after adjusting for demographic variables and trauma characteristics. Profiles for youth with PM were more severe than youth who experienced either PA or SA only. Co-occurring PM and PA was associated with the most severe trauma exposure profile and with severity of PTSD symptoms, even after adjusting for demographic and trauma characteristics. Youth exposed to SA only had a distinct trauma profile and greater PTSD symptom severity after adjusting for demographic and trauma characteristic variables.

Data were taken from the 14 and 30-year follow-ups of the Mater-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy (MUSP) in Australia. A subsample of 2064 mothers and children (59.0% female) whose data on maternal IPV and child maltreatment was available, were analysed. In families with maternal IPV, two in five children reported being maltreated, compared to one in five children maltreated in families without maternal IPV. Except for sexual maltreatment which was consistently higher in female offspring, there was no gender differences in experiencing different types of maltreatment in families manifesting maternal IPV. Although both males and females were at increased risk of child maltreatment in families where mothers were victimized by their male partners, male children were more likely to be emotionally maltreated. The main associations were substantially independent of measured confounders, except for father&rsquo;s history of mental health problems which attenuated the association of maternal IPV victimization and male offspring&rsquo;s physical abuse. Our findings confirm that there is a robust association between maternal IPV and child maltreatment. Both maternal IPV victimization and child maltreatment co-occur in a household characterized by conflict and violence. Consequences of IPV go beyond the incident and influence all family members. Efforts to reduce child maltreatment may need to address the greater level of IPV associated with the cycle of family violence.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS014521341830214X%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D2618fbc6c13b7894047daa424fff2cb1","2018-05-29 00:00:23","51","Child Abuse and Neglect"

There is still little research with adult family and community members in communities from which SICY originate. Forty men and women from five semi-rural villages in Meru County, Kenya participated in a Rapid Rural Appraisal utilizing a fishbone diagram to explore main and underlying reasons for why children may be or may feel unwelcome in the home and thus migrate to the street. Responses were analyzed in terms of ecological levels, child or parent perspective, and the push/pull framework. Overall, community members identified families and households experiencing stress and lacking the necessary resources to successfully adjust and adapt. Four ecological levels of influence were proposed as main reasons, with parent and caregiver factors mentioned most often, followed by household factors, children&rsquo;s intrapersonal factors, and interpersonal (family) factors. Community and environmental level factors were also proposed as underlying factors. Analysis by gender revealed that both men and women emphasized push factors over pull factors, though men proposed more pull factors (from peers and street life) than women did. Men placed more responsibility on the children than women did, citing children's negative behaviors, dissatisfaction with home, and a desire for independence and work/income. Women, in contrast, emphasized children's feelings of being unloved and the experience of harsh punishment or abuse from caregivers. Findings suggest that interventions to reduce street involvement should support economically, medically, and psychologically vulnerable families and households through comprehensive family strengthening programs that build financial capacity, improve parenting and communication skills, and promote education over child work and labor.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213418302084%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Da12d4b5a952aecbb47da241620b7b7b9","2018-05-29 00:00:23","39","Child Abuse and Neglect"

                  <p>This article considers the recent creation of Police Scotland and the substitution of local police forces for a national police service &lsquo;Police Scotland&rsquo; in 2013. It assesses the drivers for change and the arguments presented by both politicians and police professionals in favour of the eradication of all 8 local Scottish forces and the creation of a single police force. It contrasts developments in Scotland with those in England and Wales where there has been a recommitment to local delivery of police services in which local police boundaries have been retained with the introduction of Police and Crime Commissioners. It considers the police boundaries and coterminosity with local authorities and highlights the absence of shared boundaries within Police Scotland. It reflects on the removal of local accountability in Scotland with the abolition of Police Boards and the creation of a national and unelected Scottish Police Authority. It highlights the significance of police planning led by senior officers from Strathclyde Police and the impact of this on Police Scotland. It raises legitimate questions as to the overall efficacy of a national force made answerable to a nationally appointed body, the Scottish Police Authority. Finally, it makes a number of recommendations which might go towards someway to re-establishing a degree of local accountability to communities and local governments in Scotland which is now so clearly absent.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1057/s41300-018-0044-9","2018-05-29 13:15:24","39","Crime Prevention and Community Safety"

                  <p>The objective of this study was to examine the role of athletes&rsquo; support networks in doping in sport from a crime prevention perspective. To achieve this objective, the researchers conducted an in-depth script analysis of documents related to investigations in 2012 by the United States Anti-Doping Agency and in 2015 by the Cycling Independent Reform Commission of the doping programme carried out by the US Postal Service cycling team between 1996 and 2012. The results suggest that athletes&rsquo; support networks&mdash;such as team doctors, sports scientists, team directors and family members&mdash;play a critical role as social facilitators in doping in sport by encouraging, supporting and protecting both the doping programmes and the athletes who participate in them. This paper argues that a greater proportion of prevention measures must focus beyond the athlete themselves and on the activities of individuals within an athlete&rsquo;s support network. The paper proposes several situational prevention strategies specifically targeting the activities of social facilitators.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1057/s41300-018-0045-8","2018-05-29 13:15:24","48","Crime Prevention and Community Safety"

                  <p>A model of &lsquo;positive youth justice&rsquo; has been developed on both sides of the Atlantic to challenge the hegemonic punitivity and neo-correctionalism of contemporary actuarial risk-based approaches and the conceptually-restricted rights-based movement of child-friendly justice. This paper examines the origins, main features, guiding principles and underpinning evidence bases of the different versions of positive youth justice developed in England/Wales (Children First, Offenders Second) and the USA (Positive Youth Justice Model) and their respective critiques of negative and child-friendly forms of youth justice. Comparing and contrasting these two versions enables an evaluation of the extent to which positive youth justice presents as a coherent and coordinated transatlantic &lsquo;movement&rsquo;, as opposed to disparate critiques of traditional youth justice with limited similarities.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1057/s41300-018-0046-7","2018-05-29 13:15:24","24","Crime Prevention and Community Safety"

Design/methodology/approach This study relies on a nationally representative sample of 1,001 respondents and path analysis to test the relationships between race/ethnicity, multiple mediating factors, and confidence in order institutions.   Findings Both African and Latino Americans reported significantly lower levels of confidence compared to White Americans. People who have stronger senses of being discriminated against, regardless of their races, have reduced confidence. A range of other cognitive/evaluative variables have promoted or inhibited peopleâ€™s confidence in order institutions.   Research limitations/implications This study relies on cross-sectional data which preclude definite inferences regarding causal relationships among the variables. Some measures are limited due to constraint of data.   Practical implications To lessen discrimination, both actual and perceived, officials from order institutions should act fairly and impartially, recognize citizen rights, and treat people with respect and dignity. In addition, comprehensive measures involving interventions throughout the entire criminal justice system to reduce racial inequalities should be in place.   Social implications Equal protection and application of the law by order institutions are imperative, so are social policies that aim to close the structural gaps among all races and ethnicities.   Originality/value This paper takes an innovative effort of incorporating the currently dominant group position perspective and the injustice perspective into an integrated account of the process by which race and ethnicity affect the perception of discrimination, which, in turn, links to confidence in order institutions.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-03-2017-0031?af=R","2018-05-29 14:46:51","58","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

                  <p>The aim of this systematic review of qualitative studies is to explore the opinions and experiences of primary care providers regarding violence against women. Structured searches were conducted in nine bibliographic databases (March 2016). Study identification, critical appraisal (using the CASP tool), and analyses (thematic synthesis) were conducted. 46 qualitative studies were selected. Three main themes were identified: 1) Defining violence against women and its causes; 2) Awareness of violence against women and disclosure, with subthemes: 2.1.) Barriers experienced by primary care providers; 2.2) Facilitators for providing appropriate help; 3) Actions taken by providers to help women. Violence against women was generally considered as an unacceptable act with important health consequences. Barriers to address violence against women included organizational factors, providers&rsquo; subjective feelings and perceived role, and providers&rsquo; perceptions about women facing violence against women. Facilitators included a trusting relationship with women, attentive non-judgmental listening, participate in the community, team-work and continuing education. Providing emotional support and offering information about resources were the main actions taken by primary care providers. Women-centred care, respecting women&rsquo;s decision making processes and a biopsychosocial approach may provide direction to more compassionate and supportive care while strengthening primary healthcare response.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-9971-6","2018-05-30 05:31:19","72","Journal of Family Violence"

The main challenge with regard to the implementation of the right to legal assistance is the possibility of member states to derogate from this right on the basis of the circumstances of the particular criminal case(s) involving the child. The right to legal assistance is contingent upon the proportionality clause that has been built in the Directive and therefore legal assistance is not guaranteed for every child suspect or accused. The right to other appropriate assistance is given separate attention in the Directive, which strengthens the child&rsquo;s legal position and his support during the proceedings.</div>","http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/15718174-02602004","2018-05-30 06:16:00","38","European Journal of Crime, Criminal Law and Criminal Justice"

                  <p>There are significant, detrimental effects of physical, sexual, and psychological intimate partner violence (IPV) on victims&rsquo; mental health and well-being. However, little is known about the impact of economic abuse. To address this gap, the purpose of this study was to examine the association between economic abuse and depression and to explore whether the association between economic abuse and depression could be accounted for by other forms of IPV victimization (physical, sexual, and psychological abuse). Data from 457 female victims of IPV, recruited from 14 domestic violence programs across 10 states and Puerto Rico, were examined to explore the association between economic abuse and depressive symptoms. A series of hierarchical regressions were used to examine whether the addition of economic abuse improved the association between depression over and above participants&rsquo; sociodemographic characteristics and experiences of psychological, physical, and sexual IPV. The majority (93%) of participants reported experiencing economic abuse from their intimate partner. The findings from a series of multiple regression analyses revealed that economic abuse was uniquely associated with depression after accounting for other forms of IPV victimization and the sociodemographic characteristics of the participants. Implications include the need for screening, intervention, and prevention of economic abuse among IPV victims and continued research regarding economic abuse experiences.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-9973-4","2018-05-30 06:31:29","56","Journal of Family Violence"

"11083","Examining the Functions of Prison Critical Incidents: A Preliminary Qualitative Analysis of Public Reporting","Journal of Criminological Research, Policy and Practice, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the function of crisis incidents in prisons within the UK and USA. The incidents reviewed included riots and hostage incidents, focusing only on information that was available publically. It did not intend to capture official reports not in the public domain.   Design/methodology/approach Publically available information on incidents were systematically reviewed. Functional assessment and grounded theory were employed to examine background factors, triggers and maintaining factors. In total, 25 crisis incidents were analysed (UK =10 and USA =15) from the past 30 years. It was predicted that crisis incidents would be motivated by negative and positive reinforcement, with negative more evidenced than positive. Precipitating factors (i.e. triggers) were predicted to include negative emotions, such as frustration and anger.   Findings Similarities in triggers and background factors were noted between hostage taking and riot incidents. Positive reinforcement was primarily indicated. Riots appeared driven by a need to communicate, to secure power, rights, control and/or freedom, whereas for hostage taking these functions extended to capture the removal of negative emotions, to inflict pain, to punish/gain revenge, to effect a release, to manage boredom and to promote positive emotions.   Research limitations/implications The study is preliminary and focused on the reporting of incidents in publically available sources; consequently, the data are secondary in nature and further limited by sample size. Nevertheless, it highlights evidence for similarities between types of crisis incidents but also some important potential differences. The need to understand the protective factors preventing incidents and minimising harm during incidents is recommended.   Practical implications It highlights evidence for similarities between types of critical incidents but also some important potential differences. Understanding differences between incidents is important in the tailoring of specific policies to address these areas. Understanding motivation and reinforcement is valuable in working towards the prevention of critical incidents. Understanding the protective factors preventing incidents and minimising harm during incidents is recommended.   Originality/value This is an under-researched area. The study contributes to the field not only by focusing on providing a detailed analysis of an under-used source (public reporting) but by also identifying where gaps in research remain. The results demonstrate the value in understanding incidents through their motivation, particularly in distinguishing between negative and positive reinforcement.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JCRPP-12-2017-0040?af=R","2018-05-30 12:16:18","50","Journal of Criminological Research, Policy and Practice"

Findings Even though there are some very sensitive areas within the criminal justice system where it is believed research is difficult to undertake, it can be achieved by constant reference to the needs of the victim and strict confidentiality. Given the right circumstances and approach, research into what has been previously considered areas of difficulty can be researched effectively.   Research limitations/implications Due to the research methods explored an utilised, a template for research methodology can be seen which can be transferred into any other sensitive topic that requires research. In addition, by undertaking this method, previously unheard voices of victims of historical crimes can be utilised to inform official policy and practice. However, a limitation of the approach can be the low number of respondents wishing to take part.   Practical implications Victims have an opportunity to influence public policy. The methods utilised â€œopens upâ€ the possibility for replication of research into other sensitive areas of the CJS. The methods utilised involved a number of Criminal Justice Agencies which assisted in maximising their understanding of victims experiences thorough the partnership approach. The research methods and results influencing training methods of the police as first responders to such incidents.   Social implications The social implications of this paper are that it will encourage other researchers not to be afraid of what appears to be â€œhard to reachâ€ and sensitive topics in terms of social science research. This will allow for greater numbers of marginalised individuals and victims to engage and influence the criminal justice system, thereby influencing public policy and improving the way victims of crime are treated.   Originality/value This paper is one of the few, if any, that explores ethical problems and sensitive topics such as historical reporting of sexual offences. It will have resonance for those who wish to undertake similar types of research.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JCRPP-11-2017-0036?af=R","2018-05-30 20:31:11","134","Journal of Criminological Research, Policy and Practice"

There is no legal requirement, however, to evaluate the effectiveness of these programs, and few evaluations have been conducted. Those that have suggest that at best only a small number of these interventions have been effective and those involve bystander interventions. More importantly, there has been very little research examining the effects of such interventions on men at high risk for sexual aggression, who presumably are a key target of such interventions. Research on similar campaigns in other domains should have alerted investigators to the possibility of boomerang reactance effects wherein interventions can actually have the opposite of the intended effects for high-risk college males. The few studies that directly have examined this possibility indeed are supportive of the substantial likelihood of such negative effects. Commonly used interventions may fail with high-risk men because they are likely to generate &ldquo;hostility reactance&rdquo; &mdash; one of the key causes of both sexual violence itself and the unintended adverse effects of the interventions. We raise the question of why universities have failed to address this possible effect of interventions and why previous reviews have not highlighted this possible danger.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS1359178917303646%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Db4314611c5a7fdc23a14497b6211c272","2018-05-31 00:15:11","100","Aggression and Violent Behavior"

This study aimed to adapt the ICAST child abuse self-report measure (parent and child) for use in intervention studies and to investigate the psychometric properties of this substantially modified tool in a South African sample. First, cross-cultural and sensitivity adaptation of the original ICAST tools resulted in two preliminary measures (ICAST-Trial adolescents: 27 items, ICAST-Trial caregivers: 19 items). Second, ICAST-Trial data from a cluster randomized trial of a parenting intervention for families with adolescents (N&#8239;=&#8239;1104, 552 caregiver-adolescent dyads) was analyzed. Confirmatory factor analysis established the hypothesized 6-factor (adolescents) and 4-factor (caregivers) structure. Removal of two items for adolescents and five for caregivers resulted in adequate model fit. Concurrent criterion validity analysis confirmed hypothesized relationships between child abuse and adolescent and caregiver mental health, adolescent behavior, discipline techniques and caregiver childhood abuse history. The resulting ICAST-Trial measures have 25 (adolescent) and 14 (caregiver) items respectively and measure physical, emotional and contact sexual abuse, neglect (both versions), and witnessing intimate partner violence and sexual harassment (adolescent version). The study established that both tools are sensitive to measuring change over time in response to a parenting intervention. The ICAST-Trial should have utility for evaluating the effectiveness of child abuse prevention efforts in similar socioeconomic contexts. Further research is needed to replicate these findings and examine cultural appropriateness, barriers for disclosure, and willingness to engage in child abuse research.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS014521341830228X%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D16dccadd2cb9114146a97ef72642b7cc","2018-06-01 00:00:22","45","Child Abuse and Neglect"

Drugs markets have a resemblance to counterfeit alcohol markets in as much that they share the illicit nature of the product and the need to distribute the product at the &lsquo;street&rsquo; level. Drawing on two case studies taken from a European regulator the article details the dynamics of the market, the enterprise actions of the actors and how law enforcement responses can, in certain circumstances, make the task of the distributors easier. The traditional notions of organised crime are challenged and organisation of counterfeit alcohol markets is viewed as being reliant upon those who have legitimate access to the market and are able to develop networks of commercial collaborators who by their position in the legitimate market are able to conceal their illicit actions.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10611-018-9781-z","2018-06-01 15:00:31","35","Crime, Law and Social Change"

                  <p>In recent years, law enforcement agencies have enhanced intimate partner violence (IPV) policies and increased the frequency of required training. Yet, there is limited research that addresses how experience and training are related to evaluations of heterosexual and same-sex disputants in an IPV incident. This research investigates how officers perceive heterosexual and same-sex disputants in IPV incidents and examines how officer experience, frequency, and recency of required IPV training affect evaluations. Law enforcement officers (<em>n</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;309) across 27 states responded to a hypothetical scenario of an IPV incident between a heterosexual or same-sex couple. Dependent variables included perpetrator and victim arrest, perceived fairness of non-arrest options, willingness to provide referrals for perpetrator and victim, and severity of victim injury. Officers believed that the use of some non-arrest options was fairer when the perpetrator was a gay male or heterosexual female and there were no significant effects for arrest options. Referrals to a domestic violence hotline and injury severity varied by perpetrator and victim gender and sexual orientation. While officer experience played a role in non-arrest options, frequency and recency of officer training were not related to dependent variables of interest. Officers embrace evaluations of IPV that demonstrate differential evaluations of the incident as a result of gender and sexual orientation. These evaluations may have implications for the legitimacy of claims and safety and justice for victims and officers.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9279-8","2018-06-01 15:46:35","47","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"

                  <p>The role of coping in the association between stress and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is not clear. We investigated the effects of active and passive coping strategies on the associations between police stress (administrative and organization pressure, physical and psychological threats, and lack of support) and PTSD symptoms in 342 police officers. Linear regression model was used in the analyses. The association between physical and psychological stress and PTSD symptoms was stronger in officers who used lower active coping (<em>B</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;4.34, <em>p</em>&thinsp;&lt;&thinsp;0.001) compared to those who utilized higher active coping (<em>p</em><sub>-interaction</sub>&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.027) (<em>B</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;1.79, <em>p</em>&thinsp;&le;&thinsp;0.003).

"11117","The Impact of License Plate Recognition Technology (lpr) on Trust in Law Enforcement: A Survey-Experiment","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Objectives</h3>
                    <p>We examine the extent to which individuals' knowledge of an advanced police technology (license plate recognition or ""LPR"") may impact perceptions of police. Technologies with the capacity to track individuals' movements are becoming increasingly common in police practice. Although these technologies may yield positive benefits, their use may also heighten community concerns about increased surveillance, data storage, and data security, thereby potentially negatively impacting community-police relationships.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>We utilize a survey-based experiment with randomized assignment of participants (n=405) to investigate the impact of individuals' knowledge of LPR use on a variety of police perceptions, including trust in police, community approval, respect for citizens, and respect for individual rights.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>Most respondents were unaware of LPR use prior to the survey. When compared with a control group, respondents who encountered brief mentions of LPR functions on the survey expressed significantly lower levels of trust in police. Additionally, ""strong agreement"" with other positive statements about police also appears to have declined in this sample in response to LPR information. Notably, the sample contained high pre-existing levels of trust and support for police, factors which may have moderated the impacts of LPR information.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>These results support the hypothesis that awareness of LPR use may negatively impact perceptions of police, including trust in police. More generally, although technologies like LPR represent technological innovations, they may also yield unintended consequences, including the potential to undermine police-community relations if adoption decisions are not accompanied by sufficient transparency or community support.</p>

"11118","Internationality of Women Specialty Journals: Content Analysis and Survey of Editors","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>In the USA, in criminology and criminal justice, the women specialty journals, <em>Feminist Criminology</em>, <em>Violence Against Women</em>, and <em>Women and Criminal Justice</em>, have played a key role as outlets for research on women and crime. The current study examined the internationality&mdash;presently a significant criterion used to measure the quality of scholarly journals&mdash;of these women specialty journals. In order to measure their level of internationality, two indicators are studied: (1) geographic diversity of editorial boards and (2) the patterns (frequency, countries, international collaborations, and thematic directions) of the foreign-authored articles between 2010 and 2016. The authors also conducted a survey of the editors of the three women specialty journals to identify trends in international submissions as well as editors&rsquo; perceptions of the internationalization of their journals. The results of this study confirm that the three women specialty journals are becoming more international. Finally, recommendations to encourage international diversity of editorial boards and authorships, especially from East Asia, are discussed.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11417-018-9268-y","2018-06-02 10:30:16","44","Asian Journal of Criminology"

                  <p>An estimated 15.5 million American children are exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV) every year. Such exposure negatively impacts children&rsquo;s health, development and academic performance and may also be accompanied by housing instability or homelessness. Children growing up with periods of homelessness or housing instability are at risk for many of the same detrimental outcomes as children exposed to IPV. To date there are few studies examining the interrelationships among IPV, housing instability and the impact of housing interventions on children&rsquo;s well-being. The current qualitative, longitudinal study examined mothers&rsquo; perceptions of how receipt of flexible funding designed to increase their housing stability may have also impacted their children&rsquo;s safety, stress, mood and behavior. Forty-two mothers in the Washington, D.C. metro area were interviewed three times over a six-month period about their own safety and housing stability, as well as their children&rsquo;s. Ninety-five percent of the mothers and their children were housed at the six-month interview. Mothers described improvements in children&rsquo;s stability and safety, decreases in children&rsquo;s stress levels, and improvements to their mood and behavior. They also discussed the symbiotic relationship between their own stress and well-being, and their children&rsquo;s. The provision of flexible funding to assist domestic violence survivors with their housing also collaterally impacted their children&rsquo;s safety, stress, mood and behavior.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-9972-5","2018-06-02 14:46:10","33","Journal of Family Violence"

The response to these killings, by the United States and its allies, was extremely forceful. As part of this response, US security institutions, and the health professionals who worked for them, developed an &lsquo;enhanced interrogation&rsquo;, or torture, programme to acquire intelligence from detainees in their custody. The enhanced interrogation programme has been described as a &lsquo;conflicted&rsquo; phenomenon. This article considers in detail precisely why the enhanced interrogation programme, and the role of health professionals in it, can be said to be conflicted. The article identifies a number of reasons, including: the ambiguous and divided nature of the violence used in it; the dual roles that health professionals played in the enhanced interrogation initiative as healers and interrogators; professional division over the programme's ethics and effectiveness; the serious and negative impacts that the programme had on interrogators as well as detainees; and its split legacies. Underlying these individual reasons is the sense that the enhanced interrogation initiative was &lsquo;doubled&rsquo;, something that often pulled in two opposing dimensions simultaneously, and could be interpreted in divergent ways. The article concludes with a reiteration of the reasons why torture is ethically and effectively wrong.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS1359178917300563%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D9e9b364b9d9337e00b100172f52d2a55","2018-06-03 00:15:13","55","Aggression and Violent Behavior"

Nor is it well understood how these individuals&rsquo; perceptions of what constitutes maltreatment may change over time. This study examined descriptions of behavior perceived as maltreatment by caregivers of minors in Cleveland, Ohio, USA neighborhoods. Data were obtained from two neighborhood-based cross-sectional surveys of caregivers of minors: one conducted in 1995&ndash;1996 and the other in 2014&ndash;2015. The sample consisted of 400 caregivers living in 20 census tracts with varying profiles of maltreatment risk in the 1995&ndash;1996 study, and 400 caregivers living in the same 20 census tracts surveyed in 2014&ndash;2015. Each time point, participants were asked to provide three examples of behaviors they considered to be child abuse and neglect. All responses were categorized using the 1995&ndash;1996 coding scheme. Logistic regression analyses including all 800 participants, adjusted for individual and neighborhood characteristics, and accounting for residential clustering in neighborhoods, showed that participating in the 2014&ndash;2015 survey was associated with 51% increased odds of mentioning an act of neglect and a 39% decreased odds of mentioning an act of physical abuse. No significant temporal changes were observed for inadequate supervision, emotional or verbal abuse, sexual abuse, and parental misbehavior. Associations between specific types of maltreatment and individual and neighborhood characteristics were observed. Potential practice implications and future research directions include seeking greater familiarity with caregivers&rsquo; perceptions of maltreating behaviors to better understand how these perceptions might &ldquo;translate&rdquo; into child maltreatment reports and investigations.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213418302175%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D8b9f31b2491b3d2227f20d3ed60aabb2","2018-06-03 00:15:21","44","Child Abuse and Neglect"

                  <p>It has been increasingly recognised that individuals exposed to the trauma of others within their professional roles can be affected by secondary traumatic stress (STS). Despite this recognition, there is a dearth of literature examining the prevalence of secondary traumatic stress amongst police officers in the UK. This study aims to meet this gap. Sixty-three Detective Officers from Family Protection Units (FPU(s)), primarily engaged in child protection/abuse investigations, self-reported their experiences and symptoms associated with STS through a questionnaire. Findings indicate that over half of the respondents experienced STS symptoms with 11% reporting levels of symptoms that were in the high or severe range. This study is significant in that it provides empirical evidence of issues that have so far been little documented in the UK and considers the implications for policing policy and practice in terms of the health and well-being of serving police officers.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9277-x","2018-06-03 02:16:35","87","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"

The results revealed that four of the nine behaviors were predictive of violence, yet notable variation occurred across racial groups. The validity of the remaining behavioral cues remains equivocal at this time.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9280-2","2018-06-04 10:31:32","51","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"

                  <p>Human Trafficking is an atrocious crime that represents a gross assault on human rights and the United Nations states that it is among the fast growing types of criminal activity. Recognizing the need for counteractive measures, in 2000, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the <em>Convention against Transnational Organized Crime</em> and its <em>Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children</em> (Protocol). Using measures of country compliance with the Protocol, past research offers empirical evidence that corruption is a primary deterrent to compliance. Further, previous field studies and surveys suggest that a greater share of women in government should positively contribute to country compliance; however, this result is largely not borne out in empirical studies. It is hypothesized that the effect of the share of women in government on compliance is fully mediated by corruption, indicating that there is an indirect effect of women in government on compliance, rather than a direct effect. This hypothesis is empirically tested using a mediation model and the results indicate that the indirect effect is statistically significant. The empirical results presented suggest that a greater percentage of women in government reduces country corruption, which in turn increases country compliance with the Protocol. The policy implications of these findings are discussed and include suggestions to enhance female participation in government.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10611-018-9780-0","2018-06-04 13:15:28","49","Crime, Law and Social Change"

It identifies how accountability dynamics associated with the classification and management of risk in the policing of football may explain the continued reliance on more coercive policing tactics, as well as a number of other barriers that hinder the development of PLT use at football. Despite this, the article provides evidence that PLTs can offer similar benefits to the policing of football as they do to the policing of protest.

Research has demonstrated an association between early adversity and long-term health-risk behavior development. The current study assessed the role of emotion dysregulation and facets of impulsivity as potential mediators in the relation between ACEs and general health-risk behaviors, including alcohol-related consequences and risky sexual behavior. College students (N&#8239;=&#8239;668) completed online questionnaires that assessed history of ACEs, emotion regulation difficulties, impulsivity under extreme affect, and current engagement in health-risk behaviors. Emotion dysregulation and impulsivity under extreme positive emotion, but not negative emotion, demonstrated a significant serial mediation between ACEs and alcohol-related consequences. Results also suggest that emotion dysregulation mediates the relation between early adversity and all three outcomes (i.e., overall engagement in maladaptive behavior, alcohol-related consequences, and risky sexual behavior). Impulsivity under positive or negative affect did not demonstrate a mediation effect on the three outcomes. Results of this study highlight the importance of assessing for emotion regulation skills when working with young adults with histories of adversity.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213418302333%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Db288871599922619cb146fbc6e91334c","2018-06-06 00:30:21","44","Child Abuse and Neglect"

The focus is on 163 countries for the period 2010-2015.   Design/methodology/approach The empirical evidence is based on generalized method of moments. In order to increase room for policy implications, the data set is decomposed into sub-samples based on income levels, religious domination, openness to the sea, regional proximity and legal origins.   Findings The following main findings are established. Incarcerations are more persistent in low income, Christian-protestant and Latin American countries while comparative evidence is not feasible on the basis of landlockedness and legal origins owing to unfavorable post-estimation diagnostic tests. Justifications for the comparative advantages and relevance of findings to theory building in public economics are discussed.   Practical implications First, income levels matter in the persistence of incarcerations because low-income nations vis-Ã -vis their high-income counterparts have less financial resources with which to prevent and deal with events like terrorism, political instability and violence that lead to incarcerations. Second, the intuition for religious domination builds on the fact that liberal societies can be more associated with incarcerations compared to conservative societies. The main theoretical contribution of this study to the literature isÂ that the authors have built on empirical validity to provide theoretical justification as to why categorizing countries on the basis of selected fundamental characteristics determine cross-country variations in incarcerations. Such evidence is important for theory building in public economics.   Originality/value It is important for policy makers to understand the persistence of incarcerations across nations because resources could be allocated to regions and countries, contingent on the relative importance of future incarceration tendencies.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JCRPP-11-2017-0037?af=R","2018-06-06 09:31:14","55","Journal of Criminological Research, Policy and Practice"
"11143","Integrating Religiosity Into Fraud Triangle Theory: Findings on Malaysian Police Officers","Journal of Criminological Research, Policy and Practice, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose The purpose of this paper is to conduct an empirical analysis of the factors that determine the occupational fraud behavior.   Design/methodology/approach This study utilizes primary data collected by a questionnaire-based survey on 186 police officials of Malaysia including Sabah and Sarawak. Data are analyzed using descriptive statistics, factor analysis, and cross-sectional regression.   Findings The results derived in the study showed a statistically significant positive relationship between three basic variables of the fraud theory â€“ pressure, opportunity, and rationalization with asset misappropriation. Moreover, this study revealed that religiosity is statistically significantly and negatively correlated to asset misappropriation. Therefore, the higher religiosity of an individual correlates with the lower probability involve in asset misappropriation.   Practical implications The findings will help Anti-Corruption Commission, Enforcement Agency of Integrity Commission, Police Department, and relevant agencies from Malaysia and other countries to design policies for reducing cases of fraudulent behavior.   Originality/value This study is an original work based on the primary data collection.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JCRPP-09-2017-0027?af=R","2018-06-06 09:31:15","37","Journal of Criminological Research, Policy and Practice"

                  <p>Each year, numerous 911 calls reporting a homicide are received by emergency communications centers; a small percentage of the calls are made by the perpetrator. These calls are recorded at times of great stress and are the first versions of what the callers purport to know. A linguistic analysis of the 911 call can lead to the development of hypotheses regarding a caller&rsquo;s truthfulness, which can help to guide the initial investigative strategy. The present study examined 14 linguistic variables and an additional 4 mitigating variables in an effort to determine whether any of those variables, individually or in combination, were predictive of the guilt or innocence of the caller. A sample of 50 calls to 911 centers was examined. This study identified the presence of a variety of linguistic behaviors that were correlated with an ultimate finding of guilt or innocence.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9282-0","2018-06-06 18:32:00","67","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"

"11162","Depressive Symptoms Among Police Officers: Associations With Personality and Psychosocial Factors","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>Protective psychosocial factors may reduce the risk of stress-related illnesses in policing. We assessed the association between protective factors and depressive symptoms among 242 police officers. Participants were from the Buffalo Cardio-Metabolic Occupational Police Stress (BCOPS) Study (2004&ndash;2014). Coping, hardiness, personality traits, and social support were assessed at baseline. Depressive symptoms were measured at baseline and follow-up using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale. The relationship between protective factors and the rate of change in depressive symptoms was assessed using linear regression. Logistic regression evaluated associations between protective factors and new-onset depression. Of participants free of depression at baseline, 23 (10.7%) developed probable depression during the follow-up. Odds of new-onset depression increased with increasing neuroticism (adjusted odds ratio [OR<sub>ADJ</sub>]&thinsp;=&thinsp;1.22, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11&ndash;1.35) and passive coping (OR<sub>ADJ</sub>&thinsp;=&thinsp;2.07, 95% CI, 1.06&ndash;4.03). Increasing agreeableness (OR<sub>ADJ</sub>&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.87, 95% CI, 0.78&ndash;0.96) and conscientiousness (OR<sub>ADJ</sub>&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.90, 95% CI, 0.84&ndash;0.98) were associated with decreased odds of new-onset depression. New-onset depression was not significantly associated with other coping subscales, hardiness, or social support. There were no significant associations between protective factors and change in depressive symptom scores. This study suggests certain personality characteristics and passive coping may be associated with increased odds of new-onset depression in police officers.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9281-1","2018-06-07 08:16:32","67","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"

                  <span>
                    <h3>Purpose</h3>
                    <p>Recent research provides evidence of intergenerational continuity in self-control. This body of research, however, can be advanced in several ways to enhance our understanding of this association.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>We add to this literature by examining whether maternal and paternal self-control, assessed during a child&rsquo;s infancy, is associated with latent classes of child self-control based on assessments from eight waves of data spanning age 4 to age 15. Supplementary analyses were also performed using ordinary least squares regression to examine individual child self-control at each of the eight waves.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>The results indicate that higher maternal and paternal self-control is associated with latent class membership characterizing higher child self-control. Moreover, maternal and paternal self-control were found to be equally consequential for differentiating between a low self-control relative to a moderate self-control class, whereas maternal self-control was a slightly stronger predictor than paternal self-control for differentiating a low self-control relative to a high self-control class. Supplementary OLS models revealed that both maternal and paternal self-control were statistically significant predictors of child self-control at 54 months of age and provided relatively equal contributions. But, as the child ages, the influence of paternal self-control appears to decrease as compared to maternal self-control. Closing discussion addresses the limitations of the study and directions for future research.</p>

The current field study aimed to assess the strategies utilized, and the frequency with which they are used, in confrontations within forensic investigations involving children following suspected abuse, and to assess their effects on the children's testimonies. The forensic investigations were conducted using the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Protocol. The transcripts of 224 children aged 4&ndash;14, who were referred for forensic investigation following suspected physical or sexual abuse, were analyzed. All the cases included external evidence suggesting a high probability of abuse. The results indicated that confrontations of children were utilized in more than 60% of the forensic interviews, regardless of the child`s age. The vast majority of the interviewers&rsquo; confrontation strategies involved references to the alleged suspects, with the number of confrontations ranging from 1 to 18 per interview. An examination of the children`s responses to the confrontations revealed that most of the children insisted on their initial reported testimonies; however, some of the children displayed confusion or fear, and one child recanted the allegation. The discussion addresses how confrontations and cross-examination, as a necessary stage of forensic investigation, can affect children`s testimonies, and the implications of these effects for the forensic context.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213418302382%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Dcfa5b7f8336ca4d583dd661b63d86364","2018-06-08 12:00:22","41","Child Abuse and Neglect"

"11175","Not Yet Gone, and Not Yet Forgotten: the Reasonableness of Continued Mandatory Detention of Noncitizens Without A Bond Hearing","<p>Section 1226(c) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) authorizes the mandatory detention, without the possibility of bond, of noncitizens convicted of certain qualifying offenses for the duration of their removal proceedings. Congress enacted the mandatory detention statute because it was concerned that noncitizens who are convicted of crimes will further engage in criminal activity and fail to appear for their removal hearings. To ensure noncitizens are not deprived of their constitutional right to due process, federal courts have construed &sect; 1226(c) to contain an implicit time limitation against unreasonably prolonged detention. These courts have adopted either a bright-line or case-by-case approach to determine the point at which mandatory detention without bond becomes unconstitutionally impermissible. After six months of detention, the former requires an automatic bond hearing and the latter instructs detainees to file a habeas corpus petition that, if granted, triggers a bond hearing. This year, the Supreme Court in Jennings v. Rodriguez rejected the lower courts&rsquo; construction &sect; 1226(c) and held that interpreting &sect; 1226(c) to contain an implicit time limitation is improper because the statute is neither ambiguous or unclear. The Court, however, declined to consider whether its interpretation of &sect; 1226(c) is constitutional and instead remanded the case back to the Ninth Circuit to consider constitutional arguments on the merits.</p>
<p>This Comment argues that the majority&rsquo;s decision in Jennings v. Rodriguez failed to enforce the Constitution and protect the due process rights of detained noncitizens by interpreting &sect; 1226(c) as not having a time limit on detention without bond. It further contends that while the lower courts correctly interpreted &sect; 1226(c) to include a time limit, the current approaches applied by these courts do not properly protect detainees&rsquo; constitutional rights because under both approaches, detainees cannot challenge the reasonableness of their continued detention until after six months. Limiting detainees&rsquo; opportunity to challenge their continued detention for six months raises the same &ldquo;serious doubts&rdquo; of constitutionality that Justice Breyer argued, in dissent, are raised when &sect; 1226(c) is interpreted as forbidding an individualized bond hearing. Alternatively, this Comment proposes that detained noncitizens&mdash;who pose little risk of flight or danger to the community&mdash;should receive prosecutorial discretion in the form of deferred action as to their continued detention at any point during their detention, including during the &ldquo;presumptively reasonable&rdquo; six-month period under the current two approaches. If prosecutorial discretion is not granted, detained noncitizens should then be entitled to automatic and periodic bond hearings beginning at six months of detention.</p>","https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/jclc/vol108/iss3/6","2018-06-09 03:46:04","29","Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology"
"11176","Reduced Culpability Without Reduced Punishment: A Case For Why Lead Poisoning Should Be Considered A Mitigating Factor in Criminal Sentencing","<p>The water crisis in Flint, Michigan, where residents discovered dangerous levels of lead in their water supply in 2015, has continued to unfold over the past three years and has brought the damaging effects of lead exposure to national attention. When developing children are exposed to even low levels of lead, they are at risk of developing cognitive impairments&mdash;disorders that cause aggressive behavior and diminished intellectual functioning. This Comment seeks to bring criminal law into the conversation about lead exposure and its damaging effects. Researchers have found that children exposed to lead have a higher risk of engaging in criminal behavior. But the neurological impact of lead exposure in children suggests these children may not possess the culpability that traditionally justifies criminal punishment. This Comment proposes that, in accordance with the utilitarian and retributive goals of criminal law, evidence of lead exposure and resulting brain damage be considered mitigating factors in sentencing.</p>","https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/jclc/vol108/iss3/5","2018-06-09 03:46:04","36","Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology"
"11177","Parental Prisoners: the Incarcerated Mother's Constitutional Right to Parent","<p>The United States prison population has grown at alarming and unprecedented rates in recent decades, with certain states imprisoning more individuals than entire countries. Recently, the number of incarcerated women has climbed faster than that of men. The high rate of female incarceration has devastating effects on society, as many women are mothers and primary caregivers. Furthermore, every year, a number of mothers give birth in prison. When this happens, the mother&rsquo;s family and loved ones are often not permitted to be present. The mother gives birth in a room with only medical personnel and prison guards. She then generally has fewer than forty-eight hours to spend with her child before he or she is taken away. Sometimes the child is fortunate enough to live with other family members, but other times, the child is placed in the foster care system. Due to a number of restrictions and obstacles, many incarcerated women are forced to forfeit their paternal rights during incarceration. While some programs exist in the United States, for the most part, there are few avenues of support for incarcerated mothers. This Comment explores the possibilities currently available to incarcerated mothers, arguing that the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees the right to parent and that right should be extended to incarcerated mothers.</p>","https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/jclc/vol108/iss3/4","2018-06-09 03:46:04","49","Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology"
"11178","The Effects of Body-Worn Cameras on Police Activity and Police-Citizen Encounters: A Randomized Controlled Trial","<p>Many have suggested that placing body-worn cameras (BWCs) on police officers improves the civility of police-citizen encounters and enhances citizen perceptions of police transparency and legitimacy. In response, many police departments have adopted this technology to address public concerns over the quality of policing in their communities. The existing program evaluation evidence on the intended and unintended consequences of outfitting police officers with BWCs is still developing, however. This study reports the findings of a randomized controlled trial involving more than 400 police officers in Las Vegas, Nevada. We find that officers equipped with body-worn cameras generated fewer complaints and use of force reports relative to officers without cameras. BWC officers also made more arrests and issued more citations than their non-BWC counterparts. The findings of this randomized controlled trial raise the possibility that planning for the placement of BWCs on officers should consider the competing effects of improvement in civilian perceptions of police generated by reductions in complaints and use of force incidents and of public concerns about increased enforcement activity.</p>","https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/jclc/vol108/iss3/3","2018-06-09 03:46:04","294","Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology"
"11179","A Broken Windows Theory of Sexual Assault Enforcement","<p>The law of sexual assault is in conflict. Jurisdictions struggle with the conceptual shift from thinking of rape as forcible sex to a broader understanding that turns on the meaning of consent. Due to resource, evidentiary, and reporting problems there is a mismatch between the new substantive understanding of sexual assault and its actual enforcement. This has led to something of a cultural war by survivors and many women generally against the idea of &ldquo;rape culture,&rdquo; which runs the risk of categorizing all sexualized or gendered speech and much of male behavior as implicitly rape-supportive. This article proposes that lessons from broken windows policing can assist prosecutors in addressing the expressive gap between the law&rsquo;s definition of sexual assault and the current realities of under-enforcement and victim disempowerment. I suggest that enforcement of existing laws against the lower level street harassment of women, on the occasions it already meets the elements of assault or sexual assault, will likely have two positive effects. First, while the efficacy of broken windows theory is hotly debated, to the extent that aggressive enforcement of lower level crimes of disorder does translate into a reduction in more serious offenses, more convictions for street harassment may result in a longer-term reduction in more serious sexual assaults that are much harder to detect and prove. Second, and perhaps more importantly, aggressive prosecution of even &ldquo;harmless&rdquo; non-consensual street harassment would help to resolve the expressive problems surrounding the law&rsquo;s definition of non-consensual sex more broadly. This would combat&mdash;more concretely and less divisively&mdash;the norm of default access to female bodies than the amorphous, extra-legal critique of &ldquo;rape culture&rdquo; has thus far</p>","https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/jclc/vol108/iss3/2","2018-06-09 03:46:04","92","Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology"
"11180","Virtual Shackles: Electronic Surveillance and the Adultification of Juvenile Courts","<p>In recent years, there has been a groundswell of attention directed at problems within the American criminal justice system, led in part by Michelle Alexander&rsquo;s groundbreaking book, The New Jim Crow, and most recently through the efforts of the Black Lives Matter movement. This increased focus on the harms of over-incarceration and net-widening, has had the benefit of introducing to the public other practices utilized in the criminal justice system, such as the widespread use of ankle monitors to track the location of defendants and released offenders. Yet, despite this greater attention, legal scholarship has only recently begun to grapple with many of the issues arising at the intersection of criminal justice and technology, and even more, how these issues affect the juvenile justice system. This paper seeks to draw attention to and generate greater discussion on the ways in which advancing surveillance technologies are deployed in the criminal justice system and the reciprocal impact it has on the development of juvenile justice policies and practices. Specifically, it examines the use of electronic surveillance technology by juvenile courts as a manifestation of adultification, where juvenile courts adopt a &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo; approach and implement tools and practices from the adult criminal justice system, despite having great discretion to explore alternatives. This paper analyzes these connections and argues that correctional practices, adopted from the adult criminal justice system for implementation with youth, should be validated for effectiveness by social science evidence and community-informed policymaking. This form of accountability is crucial not only for garnering critical reflection on the use of electronic surveillance, but also for positioning juvenile courts to make better decisions in the future when contemplating adoption of even more advanced and powerful surveillance technologies.</p>","https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/jclc/vol108/iss3/1","2018-06-09 03:46:04","69","Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology"

However, it is unclear whether substantiation vs. an investigation not resulting in substantiation has a greater impact on subsequent adolescent health. Propensity scores were used to examine the effect of investigated reports on the subsequent health of 503 adolescent females. CM was categorized into three levels: 1) investigated and substantiated, 2) investigated but unsubstantiated, and 3) no investigation. Models using inverse propensity score weights estimated the effect of an investigation on subsequent teen motherhood, HIV-risk behaviors, drug use, and depressive symptoms. Females with any investigation, regardless of substantiation status, were more likely to become teen mothers, engage in HIV-risk behaviors, and use drugs compared to females with no investigated report. Substantiated CM was associated with depressive symptoms. Findings underscore the importance of maintaining case records, regardless of substantiation, to better serve adolescents at risk for deleterious outcomes.

                  <p>Cognitive approaches to training for the detection of improvised explosive devices (IED&rsquo;s) are of increasing importance. However, there is a question as to the degree to which such training might interfere with other important law enforcement (LE) functions in the field, and the degree to which such training might enhance other important cognitive/perceptual functions. A promising cognitive approach to IED training, the SMOKE system, was provided to respondents, who then responded to shoot/no-shoot decisions, important LE situations of increasing relevance. It was shown that SMOKE training did not interfere with shoot/no-shoot decisions. However, those with SMOKE training performed better than control respondents on eyewitness memory for the perpetrator of a given crime in field-valid scenes. This indicates that cognitively based training may enhance vigilance and resultant memory in field situations.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9283-z","2018-06-11 08:16:36","39","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"

However, the only other correlate of interpersonal safety skills was anxiety, with children who had greater anxiety disclosing earlier but also being more likely to agree to leave with the confederate.

Development of a CA scale would create numerous research opportunities within MIDUS and overcome some of the challenges of using a secondary dataset. The present study aimed to demonstrate that a cumulative measure of CA that is valid with older adults could be created using retrospective MIDUS Refresher study data (Ryff et al., 2016); analysis included data collected from 2011 to 2014 from 2542 adults ages 23&ndash;76 (1017 adults 55&ndash;76). The present study provided a rationale for which measures of CA to include in a cumulative scale. The distribution of eight types of CA and the cumulative CA scale were consistent with findings from past studies of CA. The factor structure of the cumulative CA scale was similar to the original ACE study and included two factors: household dynamics and child abuse/neglect. Consistent with past studies, the CA scale predicted a negative association with life satisfaction and a positive association with number of chronic conditions.

"11218","Civil Legal Aid and Domestic Violence: A Review of the Literature and Promising Directions","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>This note summarizes extant research on civil legal aid, which includes provision of legal services for indigent and low-income individuals, and its applications for DV and IPV victims, and concludes with suggestions for improving service delivery and research in the field. Results of searches of online databases for peer-reviewed and non-peer reviewed articles, reports, analyses, and evaluations of civil legal aid in the United States were analyzed and critically assessed. Civil legal aid is a promising but underfunded and underexplored avenue for responding to and reducing domestic violence (DV), intimate partner violence (IPV), and their devastating effects. Providing civil counsel in divorce, custody, and protective order proceedings can significantly improve outcomes for DV and IPV victims and their children as well as serve as a cost-effective strategy for reducing violence and generating positive social returns.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-9974-3","2018-06-12 23:16:20","66","Journal of Family Violence"
"11219","The Impact of Beliefs Concerning Deception on Perceptions of Nonverbal Behavior: Implications For Neuro-Linguistic Programming-Based Lie Detection","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>Regularly employed in a forensic context, the Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) model purports that the behavioral distinction between somebody who is remembering information and somebody who is constructing information lies in the direction of their eye movements. This strategy reflects numerous current approaches to lie detection, which presume that nonverbal behavior influences perceptions and judgments about deception. The present study emphasized a reverse order by investigating whether <em>beliefs</em> that an individual is deceptive influence perceptions of the respective individual&rsquo;s nonverbal behavior as indicated by observed eye movement patterns. Sixty participants were randomly assigned to either a group informed that right eye movements indicate constructed and thus deceptive information or a group informed that left eye movements indicate constructed and thus deceptive information. Each participant viewed six investigative interviews depicting the eye movement patterns of mock suspects labeled as deceptive or truthful. The interviews were structured according to different right/left eye movement ratios. Results revealed that participants reportedly observed the deceptive suspects displaying significantly more eye movements in the direction allegedly indicative of deception than did the truthful suspects. This result occurred despite the fact that the actual eye movement ratios in both deceptive/truthful sets of interviews were identical and the eye movements were predominantly in the opposite direction of that allegedly indicative of deception. The results are discussed in the context of encoding-based cognitive-processing theories. Limitations on the generality of the results are emphasized and the applicability (or lack thereof) of NLP-based lie detection in forensic contexts is discussed.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9278-9","2018-06-13 04:16:32","31","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"

The body was found in the uninhabited house, on the floor covered with rubbish, in the room with no doors and windows. Thermal conditions in the room were less variable than in the local weather station, however still much more variable compared to the typical indoor habitat, indicating the need for retrospective correction of temperature records from the station. Cadaver entomofauna was surprisingly diverse and abundant. We recorded several taxa usually not occurring on indoor cadavers, e.g. immature stages of <italic>Necrodes littoralis</italic> (Coleoptera: Silphidae) or <italic>Stearibia nigriceps</italic> (Diptera: Piophilidae). PMI was based on the age and the pre-appearance interval estimated for live puparium of <italic>S. nigriceps</italic>, giving the total interval of 37 (&plusmn;7.4) days plus 4&ndash;20&#8239;days resulting from the absence of first colonizing specimens of the species. This estimate was corroborated with the age estimate for empty puparia of <italic>S. argyrostoma</italic> with traces of <italic>Nasonia</italic> eclosion.

Our results revealed five key areas of opportunity for improving collaboration: recognizing the desire for cross-training; knowing who has authority when; nurturing the &lsquo;serve&rsquo; component of school policing; gaining community support; and the need for strategic documentation. The present study serves a larger purpose, which is to inform the development of a strategic framework to guide school policing programme implementation.

While policing research has demonstrated performing community-oriented policing (COP) activities generally improves police officer job satisfaction, the mechanism through which it occurs remains unclear. This study contributes to the community-policing literature through a survey of 178 police officers at the Toronto Police Service. The survey instrument measures the mechanism through which job satisfaction is impacted. Results indicate that primary response officers are more likely to be somewhat or very unsatisfied with their current job assignment compared with officers with a COP assignment&mdash;confirming what previous research has found. Further, those who interact with the public primarily for the purpose of engaging in problem-solving are more likely to be very satisfied with their current job assignment compared with those who do so primarily for the purpose of responding to calls for service. Engaging in problem-solving increases the odds of being very satisfied in one&rsquo;s job assignment, and the combination of frequent contacts with the public and problem-solving is less important than problem-solving alone. The implications of the study findings for COP strategies are discussed.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay033/5037739?rss=1","2018-06-14 11:02:06","83","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"

The purpose of the current study is to examine the associations between ACEs experienced in infancy and toddlerhood and adaptive behavior and academic status in middle childhood. We used data collected from a sample of low-income families during the impacts study of Early Head Start (EHS). Data were collected by trained interviewers demonstrating at least 85% reliability with protocols. Data come from 1469 socio-demographically diverse mothers and children collected at or near ages 1, 2, 3, and 11. At ages 1, 2, and 3, an EHS-ACEs index was created based on interview and observation items. The EHS-ACEs indices were averaged to represent exposure across infancy and toddlerhood. At age 11, parents were asked about school outcomes and completed the Child Behavior Checklist. Across development, children were exposed to zero (19%), one (31%), two (27%), and three or more ACEs (23%). Logistic regression analyses, controlling for EHS program assignment, and parent, school, and child characteristics, showed ACEs were significantly associated with parental report of the child: having an individualized educational program since starting school and in the current school year, having been retained a grade in school, and problems with externalizing and internalizing behavior, as well as attention.

                  <p>Like the rest of the social sciences, criminology is dominated by Western scholars, literature and perspectives. This Westerncentrism of criminology means that non-Western criminological scholarship has largely been marginalised or ignored. This article contributes toward the ongoing efforts to decolonise criminology by arguing that the Malaysian intellectual, Syed Hussein Alatas (1928&ndash;2007), is worthy of greater inclusion in criminological research and teaching due to his pioneering scholarship. More specifically, Alatas deserves greater recognition within the criminological subfield of &lsquo;crimes of the powerful&rsquo;, an area within criminology which has been at the forefront of challenging the criminological status quo but which remains somewhat parochial. This article introduces Alatas&rsquo; most notable works and explains their relevance for contemporary criminology.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10612-018-9396-9","2018-06-15 10:30:42","48","Critical Criminology"

                  <p>Crime pattern theory claims that busy places generate crime through immediate and delayed exploitation. In delayed exploitation, offenders notice criminal opportunities during opening hours but return to exploit them later. This study investigates delayed exploitation by testing whether soccer stadiums locally increase police-recorded property crime on non-game days. A soccer stadium closure created a natural experiment. We estimate linear regression difference-in-difference models to compare crime rates on non-game days around the stadium, before and after the closure. The closure reduced non-game day property crime beyond the citywide property crime drop. We conclude that criminogenic effects of busy places extend beyond their opening hours, confirming the delayed exploitation mechanism and that crime-prevention strategies should also target these places outside opening hours.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1057/s41284-018-0142-5","2018-06-15 14:32:03","42","Security Journal"

A Typology of Officers Who Policed the 2011 Stanley Cup Riot","<span><div>Abstract</div>Moving away from high-profile, hard-lined tactics, approaches to crowd policing have become increasingly geared towards softer, negotiation-based policing methods. Despite their perceived benefits, there exist a number of challenges relating to the successful implementation of these low-profile approaches, most notably being the officers themselves. Given the central role officers play in responding to and managing crowd situations, it is important to know what types of officers are actually deployed to police these events. Utilizing survey data collected in the aftermath of the 2011 Stanley Cup riot, this study employed a cluster analysis to examine the similarities and differences amongst the officers who were deployed to police this event. This technique produced two distinct clusters, which were subsequently used to examine the relationship between officer characteristics and orientations towards crowd policing. By providing a possible explanation for the success and/or failure of a particular crowd management strategy, these results may help police departments in their preparations for future crowd events.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay036/5038585?rss=1","2018-06-15 17:01:50","79","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"

Design/methodology/approach The paper describes how the theoretical rationale and model of change underpinning Kaizen can be applied to those with high levels of psychopathic traits given the available literature in this area.   Findings It is argued that Kaizen is applicable to those meeting the criteria for psychopathy.   Research limitations/implications As a contemporary intervention, the efficacy of Kaizen in its ability to support participants in their journey towards desistance and therefore to contribute to the service wide aim of reducing reoffending is yet to be evaluated. In turn, its applicability to those meeting the criteria for psychopathy is yet to be explored.   Practical implications This paper lends support to the applicability of Mann and Carterâ€™s (2012) six organising principles of programme design in the treatment of high risk, high need offenders who meet the criteria for psychopathy. It encourages practitioners to consider Kaizen as a possible intervention option for this population and offers guidance as to how the programme might be used to best effect. The paper also highlights the importance of evaluating the efficacy of participation in Kaizen for this population.   Originality/value In time, Kaizen will replace Chromis as the offer by Intervention Services (HMPPS) for high risk offenders with a high level or combination of psychopathic trait. This paper describes this forthcoming change in approach and the rationale underpinning it.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JCRPP-11-2017-0034?af=R","2018-06-16 08:16:15","47","Journal of Criminological Research, Policy and Practice"

The majority of the literature exploring diagnostic decision-making in this field is anecdotal or survey-based and there is a lack of studies exploring decision-making around suspected abusive head trauma (AHT). We aimed to determine factors influencing decision-making and multidisciplinary collaboration in suspected AHT cases, amongst 56 child protection professionals. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with clinicians (25), child protection social workers (10), legal practitioners (9, including 4 judges), police officers (8), and pathologists (4), purposively sampled across southwest United Kingdom. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and imported into NVivo for thematic analysis (38% double-coded). We identified six themes influencing decision-making: &lsquo;professional&rsquo;, &lsquo;medical&rsquo;, &lsquo;circumstantial&rsquo;, &lsquo;family&rsquo;, &lsquo;psychological&rsquo; and &lsquo;legal&rsquo; factors. Participants diagnose AHT based on clinical features, the history, and the social history, after excluding potential differential diagnoses. Participants find these cases emotionally challenging but are aware of potential biases in their evaluations and strive to overcome these. Barriers to decision-making include lack of experience, uncertainty, the impact on the family, the pressure of making the correct diagnosis, and disagreements between professionals. Legal barriers include alternative theories of causation proposed in court. Facilitators include support from colleagues and knowledge of the evidence-base. Participants&rsquo; experiences with multidisciplinary collaboration are generally positive, however child protection social workers and police officers are heavily reliant on clinicians to guide their decision-making, suggesting the need for training on the medical aspects of physical abuse for these professionals and multidisciplinary training that provides knowledge about the roles of each agency.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213418302497%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D224ecf581d73c203fb70e65d09fa22d7","2018-06-16 12:30:21","53","Child Abuse and Neglect"

                  <p>In the wake of high-profile deadly force cases in the post-Ferguson era, a number of negative psychological outcomes have been depicted by law enforcement officers. We examine if negative post-Ferguson outcomes predict current cynicism, motivation, and apprehensiveness. Further, we account for whether role orientations, specifically support for a law enforcement orientation or a community policing orientation, mediate the psychological effects of the post-Ferguson period. Since the law enforcement orientation, exercised through strict enforcement of the law, has been called out of favor in the post-Ferguson area, supporting this role may negatively impact officers via role conflict. The opposite may be observed for those supporting a community policing orientation. We test these arguments using results from an online survey of law enforcement officers in the USA, administered 6&nbsp;months following highly publicized incidents in Dallas and Baton Rouge where police were targeted and killed. Results showed that post-Ferguson psychological impacts continued to affect current levels of cynicism, motivation, and apprehensiveness. Support for law enforcement or community policing orientation did not mediate the effects of post-Ferguson sentiments. Nonetheless, role orientations played a significant role in predicting current cynicism, motivation, and apprehensiveness and provided support for the theory of role conflict.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9284-y","2018-06-17 00:16:33","73","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"

Few studies, however, have examined long-term consequences of CSA and maltreatment among adopted children. Guided by a polyvictimization framework, the present study investigated: (a) rates of co-occurrence of pre-adoptive CSA and maltreatment among adopted children, and (b) the relative impact of pre-adoptive CSA and maltreatment on externalizing behaviors at 14 years post-adoption. Analyses were based on four waves of data from the California Long-Range Adoption Study (CLAS) (<italic>n</italic>&#8239;=&#8239;522); outcomes were measured using an adapted version of the Behavioral Problems Index (BPI). The diverse sample (36% non-White) was evenly divided by gender (50% female/male) and included a large number of children adopted from foster care (42.1%). Results indicated that 24.3% (<italic>n</italic>&#8239;=&#8239;127) of children experienced at least one form of maltreatment; of those children, nearly half (46.5%; <italic>n</italic>&#8239;=&#8239;59) experienced multiple abuse types (e.g., neglect, sexual, physical).

An online survey was conducted with 946 general population Californians obtained through mixed-mode random probability and quota-based recruitment methods. Using an experimental vignette design, participants were randomly assigned to two scenarios: a) potential child abuse occurring in their neighborhood; b) potential child abuse in an unfamiliar neighborhood. Weighted multivariate logistic regression models assessed relationships between the vignette condition, collective efficacy, appraisal of the behavior, and likelihood of reporting or intervening. The results suggested that perceiving the vignette as occurring in your own neighborhood was associated with lower odds of viewing the behavior as appropriate and considering it abusive. Higher collective efficacy scores were associated with lower odds of viewing the incident as inappropriate but higher odds of personally intervening. Adverse childhood experiences were positively related to reporting the incident to child protective services and intervening. Bystanders may be more likely to give parents in their own neighborhood ""the benefit of the doubt"" by viewing their abusive behaviors as less severe, potentially leading to underreporting. Neighborhood collective efficacy might increase willingness to personally intervene, but not contact systems such as child protective services or police, suggesting that enhanced trust in communities does not extend to these institutions. Our findings have implications for neighborhood and education interventions to enhance understanding of and willingness to intervene on behalf of children.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0145213418302436%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Ddc1280873ca47dadd39e1f2fe377681a","2018-06-18 02:15:27","48","Child Abuse and Neglect"

"11272","This Nudge Was Not Enough: A Randomised Trial of Text Message Reminders of Court Dates to Victims and Witnesses","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Research Question</h3>
                    <p>Do text messages to mobile phones of victims and witnesses two or three days before they are scheduled to appear in court reduce their non-appearance rates in minor criminal cases?</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Data</h3>
                    <p>A sample of 811 victims and witnesses sent a postal notice to attend a specific magistrates&rsquo; court in Staffordshire on a specific date. Cambridge Crime Harm Index value of the criminal charges, court appearance and trial outcome data were collected in all cases.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>A text message reminder was randomly assigned to be sent to 405 treatment cases 2&ndash;3&nbsp;days before the court trial date. Treatment as delivered comprised 84% of the treatment group.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Findings</h3>
                    <p>The base rate of victims and witnesses not attending magistrates&rsquo; trials prior to the RCT was 26%. The non-attendance rate during the RCT was 22% in the control group and 24% in the treatment group (<em>p</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.444). A 14% higher guilty rate for trials attended by the treatment group (58%) than the control group (51%) was marginally significant (<em>p</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.052). No treatment-control differences in attendance were found when moderated by crime type or Crime Harm Index score.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>A text message in isolation did not significantly affect victim and witness attendance at criminal cases in the three magistrates&rsquo; courts. However, it does show that texting is a reliable, quick and cheap method of communicating with witnesses.</p>

"11274","Violent Women: Treatment Approaches and Psychodynamic Considerations","Journal of Criminological Research, Policy and Practice, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose Some psychodynamic approaches conceptualise female violence as a communication of experiences too difficult to think about. As practitioners, understanding what may be too painful to be thought about is incredibly important in assessment and treatment of forensic populations. Incorporating psychodynamic concepts such as splitting, transference, projection and counter-transference into formulation can be extremely helpful in understanding and formulating womenâ€™s risk of violence. The purpose of this paper is to introduce how psychodynamic concepts can be incorporated into understanding, assessment, formulation and treatment with this complex client group. This paper will also outline treatment approaches with this population.   Design/methodology/approach This paper will review existing psychodynamic literature and apply this knowledge to working with violent female offenders. Translating theory into reflective practice will be presented.   Findings This paper presents the value of incorporating psychodynamic considerations into existing strategies of understanding and working with violent female offenders. Ways forwards and research directions are proposed.   Research limitations/implications This paper is focussed primarily on psychodynamic approaches to understanding this population   Practical implications Psychodynamic concepts can add an additional dimension to formulation, supervision and treatment approaches with this population. Examining the meaning of violence perpetrated by women as well as enactments can improve practitionerâ€™s depth of understanding. Empirical research examining the benefits of psychoanalytic supervision would be extremely useful to explore the impact on formulation, treatment approaches, treatment effectiveness, staff well-being and staff retention.   Originality/value There is a lack of literature considering the application of psychodynamic constructs to help formulation of complex female offenders in the Offender Personality Disorder Pathway for women.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JCRPP-08-2017-0025?af=R","2018-06-19 08:16:12","42","Journal of Criminological Research, Policy and Practice"
"11275","Organizational Correlates of Police Deviance","Policing: An International Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose Many examinations of police misconduct involve case study methodologies applied to a single agency, or a handful of agencies. Consequently, there is little evidence regarding the types of misconduct across agencies, or the impact of department-level characteristics on the nature and prevalence of officer deviance. The purpose of this paper is to address this research gap using statewide data of over 1,500 charges of police misconduct filed with the Arizona Peace Officer Standards and Training Board (AZPOST) from 2000 to 2011.   Design/methodology/approach This study examines variation in the prevalence and forms of misconduct across 100+ agencies based on agency type and size. Difference scores were calculated for every agency in the state to determine whether an agencyâ€™s level of misconduct was proportionate to the number of officers employed by that agency. AZPOST data were supplemented with Law Enforcement Management and Statistics data to identify organizational correlates of misconduct in agencies generating disproportionately low and high levels of misconduct.   Findings Results identify variation in officer misconduct across different types of agencies. Tribal agencies generally experience higher rates of domestic violence and drug/alcohol-related incidents. Smaller agencies have more misconduct allegations involving supervisors. Organizational characteristics including pre-hiring screening, accountability mechanisms and community relationships are associated with lower levels of agency misconduct.   Originality/value The use of AZPOST data enables a statewide examination of misconduct while accounting for organizational context. This study identifies organizational features that might serve to protect agencies against disproportionate rates of officer misbehavior.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-08-2017-0092?af=R","2018-06-19 08:16:55","72","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

"11423","Identifying Money Laundering Risk in the United Kingdom: Observations From National Risk Assessments and A Proposed Alternative Methodology","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>Two National Risk Assessments (NRA) of money laundering (ML) have now been published in the United Kingdom (see HM Treasury <span>2015</span> and <span>2017</span>). While both represent an attempt to identify the risks of ML, there are limitations in relation to the conceptual framework and the methodology used. This paper reviews the UK NRAs and considers whether revision of the methodology employed could help to both remedy these limitations and generate more robust findings. Drawing upon the findings of the UK strand of project Identifying and Assessing the Risk of Money Laundering in Europe (IARM), it outlines how a composite ML risk indicator was developed through analysis of threats and vulnerabilities across 43 police areas. The findings demonstrate that risks are highest in the City of London and the Metropolitan Police area, which is largely explained by the presence of organised crime groups, connections to risky jurisdictions and the cash intensity of businesses. Although the findings should be treated with caution, it is posited that this methodology could be used to help future NRAs develop a more robust framework to understand ML risk and ultimately develop more effective preventative strategies.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10610-018-9390-5","2018-06-20 01:15:53","31","European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research"

                  <p>Youth sexual offending is a serious societal concern that impacts the well-being of multiple individuals, including caregivers. The current study used a mixed-methods design to examine the mental health consequences to parents of youth who have committed a sexual offence. Semi-structured interviews and self-report questionnaires were employed with 16 parents from 10 families in Canada. Seven themes emerged from our quantitative and qualitative analyses: immediate emotional impacts; perceived stress; mood difficulties; hopelessness; and coping strategies (avoidance, problem solving, social support). We also examined ongoing parenting challenges in addressing the repercussions of the offending behavior, as well as parents&rsquo; hopes for the future of their family. Overall, findings point to the necessity of providing intervention services to parents not only to help them meet the needs of sexual offending-affected children but also to ensure their well-being so that they are able to more effectively advocate for the children in their care.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-9975-2","2018-06-20 07:16:22","30","Journal of Family Violence"
"11425","The Importance of External Stakeholders For Police Body-Worn Camera Diffusion","Policing: An International Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose The diffusion of innovations paradigm suggests that stakeholdersâ€™ acceptance of a police innovation shapes how it spreads and impacts the larger criminal justice system. A lack of support by external stakeholders for police body-worn cameras (BWCs) can short-circuit their intended benefits. The purpose of this paper is to examine the perceptions of BWCs among non-police stakeholders who are impacted by the technology as well as how BWCs influence their daily work processes.   Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted interviews and focus groups (n=41) in two US cities where the police department implemented BWCs. The interviewees range from courtroom actors (e.g. judges, prosecutors) to those who work with police in the field (e.g. fire and mental health), city leaders, civilian oversight members, and victim advocates.   Findings External stakeholders are highly supportive of the new technology. Within the diffusion of innovations framework, this support suggests that the adoption of BWCs will continue. However, the authors also found the decision to implement BWCs carries unique consequences for external stakeholders, implying that a comprehensive planning process that takes into account the views of all stakeholders is critical.   Originality/value Despite the recent diffusion of BWCs in policing, this is the first study to examine the perceptions of external stakeholders. More broadly, few criminologists have applied the diffusion of innovations framework to understand how technologies and other changes emerge and take hold in the criminal justice system. This study sheds light on the spread of BWCs within this framework and offers insights on their continued impact and consequences.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-08-2017-0091?af=R","2018-06-20 08:17:31","62","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

                  <p>This essay argues that race and class influence drug laws through politicized means. Crack-cocaine and methamphetamine production, sales, and use were met with criminalizing efforts because of their respective association with African Americans and poor Whites, two groups that have been differentially identified as threatening to hegemonic power. Despite some similarities in criminalizing outcomes, specific reactions differed. Crack-cocaine&rsquo;s publicized connection to violence resulted in extensive surveillance, arrest, and imprisonment. Attention surrounding methamphetamine, however, often linked the drug to safety hazards, including property explosions, physical distortions of users, and the pathology of un(der)employment. As a result, policing the methamphetamine problem increased detentions but not to the same extent as crack-cocaine. I contend that the current opioid &ldquo;epidemic&rdquo; has received more medicalized reactions due to opiate&rsquo;s association to middle- and upper-class Whites&mdash;social groups that are traditionally protected. I conclude by proposing that despite nuanced and unique consequences of criminalizing and medicalizing responses, each reflects a neoliberalist agenda that seeks to diffuse social threat and reinforce prevailing inequalities.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10612-018-9398-7","2018-06-20 13:45:51","33","Critical Criminology"

"11431","Predictors of Mental Health Stigma Among Police Officers: the Role of Trauma and Ptsd","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>Police officers are both at risk of exposure to trauma and experiencing PTSD and are more likely to come into contact with people with mental illness than community members. As a result, the extent and predictors of mental health stigma is an issue of concern among police officers; however, little prior research on stigma has focused on police officers. The present study examined the predictors of mental health stigma among police officers, including the experience of trauma and PTSD symptoms. Active duty police officers (<em>N</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;296) were recruited through an online survey and completed measures of trauma exposure, PTSD symptoms, and a number of dimensions of stigma (negative stereotypes, attributions, intended behavior, and attitudes toward seeking help). Findings supported that police officers experience high rates of trauma exposure and higher rates of current PTSD than the general population. Endorsement of negative stereotypes about people with mental illness was higher among police officers than the general population. Contrary to what was expected, officers meeting criteria for current PTSD endorsed more stigma about mental illness, even when controlling for common demographic predictors of stigma, including gender and knowing someone with a mental illness. Findings have important implications for the training of police officers regarding mental illness.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9285-x","2018-06-20 16:31:56","131","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"

Despite growth in the number of studies, very few have examined the social, moral, and structural elements in the current penal context that may contain the implementation and development of restorative justice. The present article builds on a case study of mainland China, offering an empirical analysis of how social, moral, and structural (legal) barriers have impeded the growth of a restorative atmosphere. That said, the key goals of responsibility, reintegration, and restoration in Western restorative justice need to be placed within its liberal democratic context. In conclusion, the article suggests that the current RJ scholarship should overcome its methodological individualism and that it may be rewarding to examine the social dynamics that link the macro socio-legal context with the micro restorative encounters.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS1756061617303543%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Df75358a5f60c308250415dbac5f8db26","2018-06-21 04:31:02","35","International Journal of Law, Crime and Justice"

                    <h3>Objectives</h3>
                    <p>This paper investigates the influence of case characteristics and investigative resources on homicide clearance rates.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>We extend a previous evaluation of a problem-oriented policing project intended to improve homicide clearance rates in Boston. Data were collected on N&thinsp;=&thinsp;465 homicide incidents that occurred between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2014. Confirmatory factor analyses are used to identify latent variables representing investigative resources, initial crime scene results, and subsequent investigative actions and forensic testing. The effects of these investigative factors on homicide clearances net other covariates were estimated using mixed effects logistic regression models. Mediation analysis was then used to decompose the total, direct, and indirect effect of investigative resources on homicide clearances. Exploratory group comparisons were examined to distinguish investigative differences in gang and drug homicides relative to non-gang and non-drug homicides.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>Investigative resources, crime scene results, and subsequent investigative actions and forensic testing were found to increase the likelihood of homicide case clearance controlling for other covariates. Investigative resources were found to produce both direct and indirect impacts on homicide clearances mediated through its positive influence on initial crime scene results and subsequent investigative actions and forensic testing. Clearance through follow-up investigation was more difficult for gang and drug homicide cases when compared to other homicide cases.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>While inherited case characteristics matter, enhanced investigative resources and improved practices increase homicide clearances. Beyond investments to improve investigations, gang and drug homicides remain particularly difficult to clear due to a lack of physical evidence and witness cooperation.</p>

                  <p>While the majority of studies on community crime have focused on socio-economic characteristics that lead to high or low rates of crime, the impact of crime on community residents&rsquo; social ties has received less attention. This study examines the impact of district-level crime rate, experience of crime, and fear of crime on individual community residents&rsquo; participation in association&mdash;which has been widely seen as an indicator of social capital&mdash;in the city of Seoul, South Korea. Moreover, as recent social capital studies look deeper into the different types of neighborhood crime connected to different types of associations, this study separately examines the impact of total crime, violent crime, and property crime on the respondents&rsquo; social, civic engagement, reward-based, and online associations. We find that district-level crime rates negatively correlated with all types of associations, but the difference between violent crime and property crime was minimal. Additionally, individual-level experience of crime significantly decreased residents&rsquo; participation in social and online associations. However, fear of crime did not show a significant effect on any type of association.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1057/s41300-018-0047-6","2018-06-21 15:30:29","42","Crime Prevention and Community Safety"

We use generalized sensitivity analysis (Harada in ISA: Stata module to perform Imbens&rsquo; (2003) sensitivity analysis, <span>2012</span>; Imbens in Am Econ Rev 93(2):126&ndash;132, <span>2003</span>) to estimate the size of unobserved heterogeneity necessary to render delinquent peer influence and school commitment statistically non-significant and substantively weak and compare these estimates to covariates in order to gauge the likely existence of such bias.</p>

                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>Unobserved bias would need to be unreasonably large to render the peer effect statistically non-significant for violence and substance use, though less so to reduce it to a weak effect. The observed effect of school commitment on delinquency is much more fragile to unobserved heterogeneity.</p>

Design/methodology/approach The authors obtained survey data from 567 sheriff deputies in a southeastern state. The authors first asked whether respondents knew their agency had a CAC, and then asked those who responded affirmatively a series of questions about the legitimacy of the council. The authors then ran an ordinary least squares regression that included organizational justice, self-legitimacy and public scrutiny as independent variables predicting perceived legitimacy of the CAC.   Findings Deputies who perceived greater organizational justice from command staff were significantly more likely to perceive the CAC as legitimate.   Originality/value In response to strained police/community relations, reform advocates have urged the police to embrace a more democratic style of policing, including allowing for more citizen oversight of agencies. The study sheds light on how line-level officers perceive such oversight.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-01-2018-0019?af=R","2018-06-22 09:32:33","50","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

The majority of the limited research on how work environment factors affect correctional personnel has examined U.S. staff. To fill this void, the current study used the job demands-resource model to explore how various personal characteristics and work environment variables affected the job involvement of staff at two prisons in southern China. The specific personal characteristics were age, tenure, gender, educational level, and assigned prison. The job demand variables were fear of victimization and role overload, and the job resource variables were instrumental communication, job autonomy, transactional justice, procedural justice, distributive justice, job variety, and supervision. Tenure, fear of victimization, transactional justice, distributive justice, job variety, and supervision had significant effects on job involvement in a multivariate regression analysis, while the other variables did not.

                  <span>
                    <h3>Objectives</h3>
                    <p>Violence reduction initiatives based on focused deterrence strategies have gained attention in recent years due to their empirical support. The evaluations have generally assessed the impact of this intervention on trends in gun violence at the aggregate level, but not at the gang level. The current study evaluates both the community- and gang-level impacts of the Philadelphia Focused Deterrence strategy.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>The intervention was assessed using a quasi-experimental design that measured trends in shootings over a twelve-year period, including two years after the implementation of the initiative. Propensity scoring and matching techniques were used to match neighborhoods and gangs, and a number of regression models were run to assess impact.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>Although a statistically significant reduction in total shootings across the treated neighborhoods was observed when compared to matched neighborhoods, the findings at the gang level were mixed. Models comparing shootings around gang territories showed significant reductions when compared to shootings around the territories of matched gangs, but pre-post-only models of treated gangs using the more rigorous measure of gang-involved shootings did not show evidence of impact.</p>

                    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>The findings suggest that focused deterrence may provide a mechanism for general deterrence among a broad pool of potential offenders. Specifically, violent gangs, even when targeted, may not be affected similarly for a variety of reasons. To better understand who is receiving the deterrence message and responding to it, future evaluations of focused deterrence strategies, when assessing impact, should include measures of the dosage of the message and other components relative to individuals and their groups.</p>

                    <p>The Pathways to Desistance data was used in analyses. Analyses utilized group-based trajectory modeling to elucidate general patterns of development of susceptibility to peer influence. The second phase of analyses utilized a series of negative binomial regression to estimate the effects of susceptibility group assignment, deviant peer association group assignment, and the interaction between these constructs for predicting offending frequency at age 23.</p>

                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>A two-group model was found to best fit the susceptibility to peer influence data. Negative binomial regression results indicate that the interactions between assignment to the High and Moderate deviant peer association groups and high susceptibility group significantly predicted elevated offending at age 23.</p>

Intentionality and power differentials distinguish bullying from general aggression between peers which may lack these characteristics. Despite the fact that nearly every investigation of bullying references this specific definition, studies infrequently constrain their assessment of bullying to ensure that intentionality and power differentials are present. This review (a) argues for why the existing inconsistency in requiring intentionality and power differentials when assessing bullying is a problem for the field, (b) explores challenges in validly ensuring intentionality and power differentials are present when assessing bullying, and (c) puts forward recommendations for more clearly distinguishing between bullying and general peer aggression in future work.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS1359178917301362%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D03e5df115ca11e84edbd4c8970e26010","2018-06-23 12:30:14","34","Aggression and Violent Behavior"

"11498","Estimating Money Laundering Risks: An Application to Business Sectors in the Netherlands","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>Current money laundering policies often rely on the same prescribed instruments for many business sectors. For &lsquo;risk based&rsquo; policies, however, it is important to know in which business sectors money laundering risks are relatively higher. This paper builds upon work conducted as part of Identifying and Assessing the Risk of Money Laundering in Europe (IARM) project and focuses on money laundering risk assessment in the Netherlands. In this paper, we discuss theoretically and empirically how these risks can be estimated and we present results based on data regarding business sectors in the Netherlands. The used risk factors include data on organised crime investments, beneficial owners, and confidential information from the Dutch Tax Office on anomalies in tax declarations by companies. Our results indicate that casinos, hotels, and the art and entertainment sector have the highest money laundering risks in the Netherlands.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10610-018-9391-4","2018-06-26 22:15:42","39","European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research"

We found that these vulnerable women were actively engaged in many services and for a long duration, early engagement was associated with greater service use, and greater service use was associated with more positive circumstances upon ending service. Results provide support for a relational approach to service that promotes not only the relationship between mother and child, and mother and service provider, but also highlights relationships among staff, between staff and management, and between community partners as integral to effective service delivery.

                  <p>Conducting air transportation in the fastest and the most comfortable manner depends fundamentally on ensuring safe and secure flights. Therefore, due to its increasing significance, the subject of airport security services has been the focus of various studies. The purpose of this study is to determine the relative importance of the factors that play a key role in airport security services. Determining the relative importance of these factors may help use the resources more effectively and efficiently, and thus enable airport checkpoint security services to be delivered at the optimal level. This study employs a multi-criteria decision-making technique known as the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). The major factors named as <em>Human Resources, Facilities and Equipment, Stakeholders, Regulation and Supervision</em> and <em>Costs</em>, and the sub-factors under these major factors were determined on the basis of the consultations held with the field experts and review of the relevant literature. Within the scope of the study, airport security staff including both practitioners and managers at various levels of work positions were selected as the participants. The AHP method was applied to the obtained data, and the human resources factor was found to be more important than the other factors, which is supported by other research findings in the aviation literature.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1057/s41284-018-0143-4","2018-06-28 09:17:24","48","Security Journal"
"11514","The Influence of Earlier Parental Violence on Juvenile Delinquency: the Role of Social Bonds, Self-Control, Delinquent Peer Association and Moral Values As Mediators","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>Previous research demonstrated that children who had been exposed to physical maltreatment by parents are at higher risk of using violence as adolescents. It is assumed that parental violence unfolds negative influences on later delinquency directly and indirectly, that is, mediated through other crime predictors. This contribution presents an empirical test of theoretical propositions explaining this cycle of violence derived from three major theories, namely social learning, self-control and social control/bonding theory. Using data from 26 countries of the ISRD3 study, the mediating roles of delinquent peer association, crime-related moral values, self-control as well as family and school bonds among juveniles of grades 7 to 9 are assessed. Moreover, with exploratory intent, it is tested if the same mediating effects apply to each country. Overall the results showed both a significant direct effect of maltreatment on the use of violence and indirect (mediating) effects via each of the considered mediators. Delinquent peer association, self-control and family bonds had higher mediational strength than moral values and school bonds. This is in support of the theoretical assumptions of all three theories. Further, great variability of direct, indirect and total effects of maltreatment on violence across countries and within each mediator were observed. There is tentative evidence that the prevalence rates of maltreatment are negatively associated with the impact of maltreatment on later violence in the considered countries.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10610-018-9392-3","2018-06-28 09:30:53","42","European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research"

Six local teams of the National Police were studied, using both interviews with officers and observations of police work. Despite the emphasis on standardization, this study showed that there are important differences between these teams. The scale enlargement of the local teams resulted in several negative side effects, such as an increase in driving time of patrol cars in rural areas, and a loss of social bonds between officers in these teams. The aim to replace traditional patrol work by problem-oriented types of policing is hardly realized in practice. Despite the emphasis on the importance of community policing, in fact community officers now have a more isolated position. The introduction of the National Police created more distance between citizens and the police and made that this relationship is now more dependent on abstract forms of communication.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay037/5046338?rss=1","2018-06-29 06:02:54","70","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"

Monash was chosen as it had experienced declining results in the official National Survey of Community Satisfaction with Policing in relation to police legitimacy and trust.   Design/methodology/approach A qualitative case study comprising 18 interviews and six focus groups with community representatives from Monash is employed in the paper.   Findings When procedural justice approaches are applied during encounters between the police and the public, encounters contribute to securing legitimacy for the police. Contact between the police and the public in everyday situations also enhances trust in the police, depending on the way the police conduct themselves during such interactions.   Research limitations/implications Findings from a qualitative case study are not able to be widely generalised but the conclusions are still useful for informing insights into processes impacting police legitimacy and trust.   Practical implications Contributes to informing evidence-based police practice around the way police conduct themselves during community interactions; informs policy decisions around allocation of funding for law enforcement with more officers required to carry out community policing; emphasises the importance of prioritising partnerships with communities; demonstrates that positive police/community relations have wider social cohesion implications in a contemporary era of counter-terrorism priorities.   Originality/value The majority of research in this field to date has been quantitative. A qualitative approach provides fresh insights into the mechanisms of police legitimacy, especially the role of encounters and procedural justice.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JCRPP-12-2017-0039?af=R","2018-06-29 08:17:39","50","Journal of Criminological Research, Policy and Practice"

                  <span>
                    <h3>Purpose</h3>
                    <p>To investigate how missing data (Missing Completely at Random [MCAR] vs. Missing Not at Random [MNAR]) on risk factors can impact trajectory solutions (i.e., latent class probabilities) and coefficient estimates capturing the relationship between covariates and trajectory group solutions using a semiparametric group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) approach.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>To address this issue, we conducted a systematic investigation using Monte Carlo simulation. Data were generated from a population with known growth parameters and risk factors. Observations for risk factors were then systematically deleted in a way that reflects key missing data assumptions (MCAR and MNAR). Models were then estimated to test the sensitivity of the estimates to each missing data scenario.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>Two key findings emerged: (1) trajectory solutions were largely unaffected by missing data on risk factors; and, (2) there was some degree of bias in estimating relationships between risk factors and trajectory group membership when data were missing on those risk factors.</p>

                  <span>
                    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>GBTM may be useful for testing etiological explanations of long-term patterns of offending. Missing data on risk factors poses a threat to this approach, however.</p>

Design/methodology/approach The project involved 24 semi-structured interviews with experienced COLE directors. The interviews were transcribed and coded and this paper presents these perspectives according to patterns identified during analysis.   Findings The research identified themes and patterns in the attitudes of the oversight directors which included numerous conditions necessary for success of an oversight agency. Amongst the most important conditions included agency independence, director job security, the need for professional qualified staff, unfettered access to information, the ability to publicly report on the agencyâ€™s work and a willingness on the part of government officials to tolerate criticism of the police.   Originality/value This is the first study to identify the challenges and impediments to sustainable COLE mechanisms from the point-of-view of experienced agency directors. The findings can be used by future practitioners to learn from past experiences.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-01-2018-0018?af=R","2018-06-30 08:17:05","73","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

Hoskin<br><abstract-sec ns2=""http://webservices.elsevier.com/schemas/search/fast/types/v4"" soapenv=""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"" view=""all""><simple-para view=""all"">Evolutionary neuroandrogenic (ENA) theory asserts that the main underlying forces behind human criminality is evolutionary (in ultimate terms) and neuroandrogenic (in proximate terms). Neuroandrogenic factors primarily refer to the influence of sex hormones on brain functioning, especially both prenatal and post-pubertal testosterone. We recently reported evidence that supports the theory. Using a rather crude measure of prenatal testosterone exposure (known as the 2D:4D digit ratio), our two studies indicated that even within each sex, prenatal testosterone was significantly correlated with various forms of self-reported offending as theoretically predicted. Since these two studies were published, two meta-analyses have appeared that ostensibly provide little evidence that 2D:4D is actually predictive of criminality and associated behavior. However, we believe that both of these meta-analyses have deficiencies in terms of methodology and theory interpretation that can account for why some of their conclusions are subject to question. The present commentary identifies the deficiencies and shows how the meta-analytic findings <italic>most</italic> pertinent to criminality actually support the hypothesis that prenatal testosterone is a significant contributor to variations in criminal behavior.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS135917891730352X%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D53a982ab4aa70cf173c33a81822f3d2a","2018-06-30 12:45:13","36","Aggression and Violent Behavior"

Males can access offence-specific interventions in prison and on probation. However, depending on national criminal justice policies, female IPV perpetrators access general offending behaviour programmes only or offence-specific programmes that have been designed with male perpetrators in mind. The extent to which men's and women's treatment needs are similar or different is unclear. The aim of this systematic review was to synthesise what is known about the risk factors for IPV perpetration by women located within criminal justice settings to inform appropriate interventions for this group of offenders. Thirty-one studies met inclusion criteria and no factors meeting our definition of risk factor were identified. However, there were associations between IPV perpetration and experience of child abuse, substance use, borderline personality traits, attachment issues and experiencing trauma. It remains unclear what factors need to be targeted in interventions for female IPV perpetrators, although associations have pointed to possible predisposing factors. In order to improve the evidence base for IPV interventions, researchers need to clearly define the term &lsquo;risk factor&rsquo;, extending beyond reporting on prevalence only, and to increase understanding of the pathways to IPV perpetration among women.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS1359178917303233%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D4e6b816d11f3d0c8b3601a0af0a0f538","2018-07-01 12:45:13","76","Aggression and Violent Behavior"

Human blood was deposited onto porous (white 80gsm paper and brown envelope) and non-porous (tile and linoleum) substrates in a depletion series (30 depletions on non-porous and 20 on porous) and subjected to three ageing periods; 1, 7 and 28&#8239;days. A number of enhancement techniques were tested [fluorescence, black magnetic powder (BMP), iron-oxide black powder suspension (PS), cyanoacrylate (CA) fuming, acid violet 17 (AV17), acid yellow 7 (AY7), ninhydrin, DFO and Bluestar Forensic Magnum (BFM) luminol] to evaluate their potential effects on subsequent presumptive and confirmatory tests. AV17 and Bluestar provided the best enhancement and fully enhanced all depletions in the series. The sensitivity of the Kastle-Meyer (KM) (presumptive), Takayama and RSID-Blood tests (confirmatory) was initially investigated to determine the range of detectable depletions. The KM test detected all depletions, whereas the Takayama test detected up to depletion 6 and RSID-Blood detected up to depletion 20 (paper), 10 (envelope), 15 (tile) and 9 (lino).

"11539","Towards A Holistic Understanding of the Prevention of Violent Radicalisation in Europe","<p>The focus on radicalisation has increased in recent years in response to incidents of international terrorism. European countries have boosted funding into various prevention policies and counter-radicalisation tools in an attempt to tackle the ever-increasing threat of homegrown terrorism, polarisation and broader social problems. However, these efforts have yet delivered coherent and effective initiatives that curtail the onset of radical tendencies, disengage those who have already embraced violent extremism, and minimise the effectivity of terrorist entities. This article introduces Pericles (Policy Recommendation and Improved Communication Tools for Law Enforcement and Security Agencies Preventing Violent Radicalisation), which is an EU funded project developed for the prevention of radicalisation and violent extremism in Europe. Pericles builds on previous counter-radicalisation approaches by addressing operational gaps and introducing developments that are modelled to the needs of practitioners. In addition, the needs of families will be explored in which the children or parents are radicalised or at risk of radicalisation. The project recognises the importance of families in identifying the signs of radicalisation and as a useful instrument for support. The project delivers a comprehensive understanding of current European counter-radicalisation programmes and policies as well as five tools that will enhance the capabilities of frontline staff in detecting radicalisation and formulating an informed response. The Pericles toolkit includes an advanced cyber-space detection system, an enhanced platform of exchange, vulnerability assessment tool, family care package, and an updated skills and competencies package.</p>","https://bulletin.cepol.europa.eu/index.php/bulletin/article/view/305","2018-07-01 23:01:03","38","European Law Enforcement Research Bulletin"

The focus then shifts to a consideration of the internal and external influences which have diluted the momentum for change.

Based on qualitative research in this country, the focus is on local ownership and the challenges posed by local culture to the implementation of COP in communities. From the beginning, COP in Kosovo was strongly related to peacebuilding and police reform efforts of the international community. After the war in 1999, UNMIK introduced COP strategies using a top-down&nbsp;approach, allowing very little local ownership and public involvement in the process. After 2004, UNMIK began to retreat and transfer more and more responsibilities to the Kosovo government. Different COP forums, like Community Safety Action Teams Programs (CSATs), Local Public Safety Community Councils (LPSCs) and Municipal Community and Safety Councils (MCSCs), were introduced. After independence in 2008, the EU took over from the UN and emphasized approaches focussing on local ownership while at the same time pushing heavily for reforms in the police sector. The outcomes of these efforts had limited success, while numerous challenges are still ahead.</p>","https://bulletin.cepol.europa.eu/index.php/bulletin/article/view/372","2018-07-01 23:01:03","68","European Law Enforcement Research Bulletin"

At the EU level, the Mission contributed to shaping the current civilian CSDP &ndash; and the EU is today better equipped to plan and run civilian missions.

                  <p>In this paper I propose a <em>transgression theory</em> and a <em>standard theory</em> toward penal abolition. I argue that given the ubiquity of &ldquo;crime&rdquo; in human relationships, to speak of &ldquo;criminal behavior&rdquo; as deviant nullifies the concept <em>deviance</em> (abnormal, out of the ordinary, etc.). After demonstrating that empirically the opposite is the case, I argue for a <em>transgression theory</em> (that most human beings regularly act in ways that transgress the norms and laws they establish) and propose a <em>standard theory</em> (that human beings are both maintainers and transgressors of the social orders they establish). My paper challenges the foundational language (constructions) of &ldquo;criminal justice&rdquo; logic that ignore the continuity of the past in the present (white supremacy, neocolonialism, racial capitalism, and gendering enslavement), and that fortify discourse and practice from recognizing, eliminating and standing accountable by rectifying centuries of white privilege, heteronormativity, and the oppression of nonwhite bodies.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10612-018-9404-0","2018-07-02 03:15:50","53","Critical Criminology"

The number of studies on bullying is high and a lot of knowledge has already been gathered. Nevertheless, there are still many gaps in knowledge that need to be addressed. Research on protective factors and effective interventions is still in its relatively early stages. This systematic review of meta-analyses on protective factors against bullying and cyberbullying was conducted to synthesize knowledge and discover the most important community, school, family, peer and individual protective factors. After systematic searches and the application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 18 meta-analyses with 128 effect sizes were included and analyzed. Forest plots were constructed and median effect sizes were calculated for each group of protective factors. Self-oriented personal competencies were the strongest protector against victimization. Low frequency of technology use protected from involvement in cyberbullying. Good academic performance and other-oriented social competencies were the strongest protective factors against perpetration. Positive peer interaction was the strongest protective factor against being a bully/victim.

                  <p>While it is generally understood that people tend not to specialize in specific types of deviance, less is understood about offending specialization and versatility in the context of friendships. Using a large sample of persons nested within friendship pairs, this study&rsquo;s goal is to explore how self-control and social learning theories contribute to an explanation for specialization and versatility in offending among friends. We estimate a series of multilevel, dyadic, mixed-effects models which regress offending versatility onto measures of perceptual peer versatility, self-reported peer versatility, attitudinal self-control, behavioral self-control, and demographic controls. Results indicate that higher amounts of perceptual peer versatility and peer self-reported versatility are both related to increases in versatility among friends. Lower levels of the target respondent&rsquo;s attitudinal and behavioral self-control are also related to higher amounts of offending versatility. However, the peer&rsquo;s self-control shares no relationship with offending versatility &ndash; a point which both supports and fails to support self-control theory&rsquo;s expectations about how peer effects should operate. Learning and self-control perspectives both appear to explain offending versatility among friends. However, self-control theory&rsquo;s propositions about how peer effects should operate are contradictory. The concept of opportunity may help remediate this inconsistency in Gottfredson and Hirschi&rsquo;s theory.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12103-018-9445-7","2018-07-03 01:30:16","64","American Journal of Criminal Justice"

                  <p>The present study compared selective attention processing among juvenile delinquents of two different citizenships and matched control groups. The sample consisted of 70 &ldquo;true&rdquo; juvenile delinquents (Indian citizen&mdash;charged for theft, rape or murder), 54 &ldquo;legally considered&rdquo; delinquents (Bangladesh citizens&mdash;charged only with illegal immigration), and 70 matched control group of Indian citizens. They were tested on object&ndash;color Stroop task designed specifically with objects typically found in South Asia. Results show that participants had taken less time in typical condition (for example, red color of red apple) compared to atypical condition (blue color of red apple). This behavioral characteristic is more specifically present in Bangladeshi delinquents and non-delinquent controls, while Indian delinquents are different from both on this measure. Demographic variables also have an influence on performance. Differences in selective attention processing were found between &ldquo;true&rdquo; and &ldquo;legally considered&rdquo; juvenile delinquents. Furthermore, the age of participants also had an influence on performance. These findings together suggest establishment of separate observation homes for juvenile delinquents. Furthermore, this is the first study to test response modulation hypothesis among offenders with psychopathic traits in an Asian country.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9286-9","2018-07-03 07:16:54","30","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"
"11562","Examining Police Use of Force and Citizen Complaints","Policing: An International Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose The purpose of this paper is to empirically examine the relationship between police use of force and citizen complaints alleging improper use of force.   Design/methodology/approach The current study utilizes official use of force and citizen complaint data, as well as surveys of patrol officers, from the Assessing Police Use of Force Policy and Outcomes Project, a multimethod National Institute of Justice funded study.   Findings Bivariate and multivariate analyses revealed that the number of use of force incidents that officers were involved in, as well as the types and levels of resistance they encountered from citizens, was related to use of force complaints from citizens. That is, those officers that were involved in more use of force situations were engaged in force encounters where the highest level of citizen resistance was â€œfailure to comply,â€ and faced higher cumulative levels of citizen resistance, received more complaints alleging improper use of force.   Research limitations/implications Studies of citizen complaints against police officers, especially those alleging improper use of force, should consider the number of force incidents officers are involved in, as well as other theoretically relevant force correlates.   Practical implications Administrators, concerned with citizen allegations for improper use of force against their officers, should work to encourage their personnel to minimize the number of use of force applications, or at least less cumulative force, to resolve encounters with citizens.   Originality/value While prior studies have examined police use of force and citizen complaints independently, the current study examines the empirical connection between use of force behavior and the generation of complaints from citizens.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-01-2018-0024?af=R","2018-07-03 08:17:16","115","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"
"11563","Understanding Police Officer Resistance to Body-Worn Cameras","Policing: An International Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose Body-worn cameras (BWCs) have been adopted in police agencies across the USA in efforts to increase police transparency and accountability. This widespread implementation has occurred despite some notable resistance to BWCs from police officers in some jurisdictions. This resistance poses a threat to the appropriate implementation of this technology and adherence to BWC policies. The purpose of this paper is to examine factors that could explain variation in officer receptivity to BWCs.   Design/methodology/approach The authors assess differences between officers who volunteered to wear a BWC and officers who resisted wearing a BWC as part of a larger randomized controlled trial of BWCs in the Phoenix Police Department. The authors specifically examine whether officer educational attainment, prior use of a BWC, attitudes toward BWCs, perceptions of organizational justice, support for procedural justice, noble cause beliefs, and official measures of officer activity predict receptivity to BWCs among 125 officers using binary logistic regression.   Findings The findings indicate limited differences between BWC volunteers and resistors. Volunteers did have higher levels of educational attainment and were more likely to agree that BWCs improve citizen behaviors, relative to their resistant counterparts. Interestingly, there were no differences in perceptions of organizational justice, self-initiated activities, use of force, or citizen complaints between these groups.   Originality/value Though a growing body of research has examined the impact of BWCs on officer use of force and citizen complaints, less research has examined officer attitudes toward the adoption of this technology. Extant research in this area largely focusses on general perceptions of BWCs, as opposed to officer characteristics that could predict receptivity to BWCs. This paper addresses this limitation in the research.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-03-2018-0038?af=R","2018-07-03 08:17:16","232","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

                  <p>Digital piracy is a global concern for society. Although adolescents&rsquo; digital piracy in South Korea is pervasive, its cause has rarely been examined. Using data collected by the Korean Institute of Criminology (KIC) in 2009, this study conducted structural equation modeling to determine if low self-control and social learning theory accounted for digital piracy. This study found that parental indifference increased adolescents&rsquo; digital piracy through low self-control and misconception about digital piracy. However, there were no direct effects of parental indifference on the digital piracy behaviors. In particular, the mediation effect in the model combining low self-control and misconception was greater compared to other models. Overall, the combination of low self-control and social learning theory provided a more meaningful framework to explain adolescents&rsquo; digital piracy. Results of this study can offer ways to aid in the examination and remediation of this particular form of deviant behaviors on the Internet by adolescents.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11417-018-9271-3","2018-07-03 09:45:16","33","Asian Journal of Criminology"

Its severe and upsetting consequences are not only experienced by the victims themselves, but also others in proximity (e.g., pet owners). Despite this, research and theory focusing on the motivations for such behavior appear to be sparse and limited in development when compared to other types of offending behavior, such as interpersonal violence. This article examines the motivations that underlie animal abuse and the maladaptive emotion regulation techniques that facilitate this type of behavior. We focus on two specific emotion regulation styles that have been implicated in existing literature; that is, the mis-regulation and under-regulation of emotions. Based on existing research and theories, we posit that the facilitative role emotion regulation plays in the perpetration of animal abuse is vital in our understanding of how and why this abuse occurs. In this article, we present a preliminary conceptualization of animal abuse behavior that depicts emotion regulation as a pivotal factor in key explanatory pathways.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS1359178917303488%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D8983c15b70c2b78803b3ff8d82f20240","2018-07-03 12:45:13","64","Aggression and Violent Behavior"

                  <p>Traditionally policymakers have paid little attention to the consumption of steroids and other performance and image enhancing drugs (PIEDs) in Australia. Yet, in recent times PIEDs have come to occupy an increasing amount of discursive space and, indeed, regulatory action. This newfound interest may be attributed to several broader developments, not least the perception of the involvement of organized crime in distributing PIEDs to the professional sports world and other sectors of this illicit market. This paper seeks to explore the empirical reality of the claim that the production and supply of PIEDs in Australia is the prerogative of organized crime groups. A retrospective content analysis of Australian PIED provider cases was conducted between 2010 and 2016. To widen our search, both media articles describing court cases, obtained from the Factiva database, and public online court records, using the Australasian Legal Information Institute (AustLII) database, were searched. Search terms included &ldquo;steroid*&rdquo;, &ldquo;doping&rdquo; and &ldquo;testosterone&rdquo; in combination with the terms &ldquo;traffic*&rdquo;, &ldquo;production&rdquo;, &ldquo;supply*&rdquo; and &ldquo;import*&rdquo;. In total, 477 PIED provider cases were identified yet most cases were duplicates, irrelevant or lacked sufficient detail, resulting in a final dataset of 144 cases. A coding schedule was developed based on existing PIED supply literature. Our data shows that most PIED provider cases took place in Queensland (41.7%), followed by New South Wales (25%) and Victoria (13.2%). Regarding the type of providers, the largest group consisted of people active in the gym industry (22%), followed by the healthcare sector (17%), the &lsquo;other&rsquo; category (12%) and the security sphere (8%). Of the 144 steroid-provider cases, only 12% of the cases indicated the potential involvement of organized crime groups, with half of those being linked to outlaw motorcycle gangs. In contrast to the claims of authorities, our data suggests that organized crime groups currently play a proportionally small role in the illicit production and supply of steroids and other performance and image enhancing drugs in Australia. Indeed, various actors are involved of which only a small fraction are part of or involved with organized crime groups. Many suppliers are particularly active in the gym industry and healthcare sector.

"11588","Preventing Near-Repeat Residential Burglary Through Cocooning: Post Hoc Evaluation of A Targeted Police-Led Pilot Intervention","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>The Western Australian Police piloted an 8-month small-scale targeted burglary prevention initiative involving distribution of crime prevention pamphlets to burglary victims and their immediate neighbors in the few days directly after victimization. External researchers then undertook a post hoc evaluation of this intervention, examining the impact with a pre- and post-comparison using Ratcliffe&rsquo;s (Near-repeat calculator (version 1.3), Temple University, Philadelphia, <span>2009</span>) near-repeat calculator (using 50&nbsp;m and 5-day intervals for space and time, respectively), analysis of police records relating to the implementation of the intervention, and an online survey of residents who had been scheduled to receive the burglary prevention information. Relative to the pre-intervention period, the near-repeat calculator demonstrated a significant reduction in near-repeat residential burglary (within 0&ndash;5&nbsp;days and 1&ndash;200&nbsp;m from the victim) but no corresponding reduction in same-address repeat victimization (within 0&ndash;5&nbsp;days). Analysis of police records explained this unexpected pattern, revealing an implementation issue had resulted in only 23% of victim addresses receiving the treatment pamphlet. Despite low-response rates to the online survey limiting the strength of the conclusions possible from this data source, trends were indicative of the pamphlet changing residents&rsquo; behaviors to reduce the opportunity for burglary. These results add support to prior findings demonstrating police can use victimization information to work in a targeted, timely manner and reduce the risk of burglary. It also emphasizes the importance of good data management practices when undertaking prevention initiatives to ensure programs are delivered as intended.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1057/s41284-018-0144-3","2018-07-05 09:18:09","147","Security Journal"
"11589","The Spatial Concentration and Stability of Crime in A South African Township","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>The law of crime concentration at places motivates that a small number of locations are responsible for a disproportionate amount of crime. Research applying the law has largely been confined to the United States and Europe with much less known about spatial crime concentrations and their stability in less developed contexts, particularly in Africa. In this study, we explore the spatial concentration of crime in a setting axiomatically different from the West, namely Khayelitsha, a township on the outskirts of Cape Town in South Africa. Specifically, we describe rape, robbery and assault concentrations in Khayelitsha from 2008 to 2015 and examine the extent to which these concentrations change over time. Similar to international research, we found that crime in Khayelitsha spatially concentrates and that these concentrations are remarkably stable. Practical implications of these findings are discussed in the context of a historically unique post-apartheid South African spatial setting.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1057/s41284-018-0145-2","2018-07-05 09:18:09","60","Security Journal"

Workplace bullying is now a phenomenon of global interest, new topics are steadily emerging within the field, and the methodological quality of the studies has become more sophisticated. Building on findings from the ever increasing number of systematic reviews and meta-analyses in this field, the aim of this literature overview was two-folded. In the first part, the aim was to provide a basic overview of what we already know with regard to the nature and content of the bullying phenomenon, its risk-factors and causes, its consequences, and its potential measures and interventions. In the second part, the aim was to address what we do not know and to put forward an agenda for future research within the field. Here, six major knowledge challenges are discussed: a) construct clarification, b) the need for theoretical models, c) causality, d) bullying as a process, e) mediators and moderators, and f) intervention and rehabilitation of victims, perpetrators, and work environments.</simple-para></abstract-sec><br><br>","http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS1359178917301611%26_version%3D1%26md5%3De792b795f110d7363f60694784b48632","2018-07-05 12:45:41","68","Aggression and Violent Behavior"

                  <p>Researchers have examined the correlates of inter-group relationships, relying heavily on Blau&rsquo;s (<em>The American Journal of Sociology, 83</em>, 26&ndash;54, <span>1977</span>) macrostructural opportunity theory. The results of these studies have given mixed support for the relationship between social structure and inter-racial violence. This study builds on existing research on inter-group violence by examining what social structural correlates may influence intra- and inter-group violence using the macrostructural opportunity theory as a guiding framework. Data from the National Incident-Based Reporting System as well as the American Community Survey are utilized to construct a large sample of counties across the United States. The findings provide mixed support for Blau&rsquo;s hypotheses, with heterogeneity and segregation showing some effects on inter-group violence, while racial inequality remains largely a non-significant predictor.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12103-018-9446-6","2018-07-05 20:45:13","39","American Journal of Criminal Justice"

Twenty-seven police leaders were shadowed during and interviewed about their daily practices of policing. We found that police leaders learn foremost through their experiences by practising leadership within the context of police culture. We therefore argue for a shift from teaching to acknowledging learning through practice instead of learning through practice constituting missed opportunities for learning and being &lsquo;due to chance&rsquo;. The Norwegian police culture and the Norwegian Police Service not being a learning organization will strongly influence what Norwegian police leaders learn. Consequently, Norwegian police leaders learn management more than they learn leadership. We argue for combining management and leadership in future police leadership practices We also argue for the importance of enabling police leaders to construct their manoeuvring space, acknowledging the importance of a manoeuvring space in police leaders&rsquo; learning to ensure their learning results in changes in established practices.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay043/5050176?rss=1","2018-07-06 18:01:56","283","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"

                  <p>One of the most persistent criticisms of the peacemaking perspective in criminology is that it lacks testable hypotheses and realistic policy implications. In this essay, we examine the applicability of peacemaking ideas to the mechanisms identified by scholars that are associated with desistance from crime. We argue that the process of desistance has many similarities with peacemaking ideas and may provide an avenue for testing some of the core propositions of the peacemaking perspective. We propose a model that depicts the relationships between variables that have been observed in the desistance literature and examine how they relate to the peacemaking perspective. Policy implications of these ideas are also discussed.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10612-018-9405-z","2018-07-06 18:30:55","69","Critical Criminology"

Problem-oriented crime deterrence strategies were used in one neighborhood, the other served as a control group.   Design/methodology/approach Mixed-methods approach was used to measure the effectiveness of problem-oriented approaches in persistent high-crime areas. Pre- and post-intervention surveys were conducted by sampling addresses in both neighborhoods and analyzing results.   Findings No between-neighborhood differences were reported regarding the satisfaction with police services or improvement in perceived safety.   Originality/value These findings suggest that this deterrence strategy is a promising approach to reducing crime while not damaging community perceptions. However, departments must vary place-based strategies, and prevention is difficult given historical contexts, the absence of credible community partners and limited resources in a declining city.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-01-2018-0002?af=R","2018-07-10 08:17:16","57","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"
"11624","Shaping Community Support For Vigilantism: A Nigerian Case Study","Policing: An International Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose In Nigeria, vigilantism appears to be a common response to dissatisfaction about the state police in the recent time. Using survey data of residents in Lagos, Nigeria, the purpose of this paper, therefore, is to explore whether what is already known about perceptions of procedural (in) justice of state police also applies to self-help security groups in Nigeria. This is with a view to influencing community support for and satisfaction with non-state policing in the country.   Design/methodology/approach The study adopted a case study approach. Lagos, Nigeria was stratified into the high, medium and low densities. Systematic sampling technique was used in selecting 1 out of every 20 buildings (5 percent) in each area. Household representative person on each floor of the selected building who had contact with vigilante corps in the last 12 months were targeted. Of 768 copies of questionnaires administered, a sample of 386 was effectively returned (representing 50 percent response rate). Six categories of variables were analyzed. These are procedural justice, distributive justice, vigilante corpsâ€™ performance, legitimacy, residentsâ€™ satisfaction with vigilante corps activities and socio-economic characteristics.   Findings Results reveal that respondents are not primarily instrumental in their support for vigilantisms. Instead, their support is associated with their basic communal values. More than effectiveness in controlling crime, vigilantisms receive community support provided they use procedural justice in dealings with the public. Respondents who perceive vigilantisms use procedural justice also view them as legitimate, and as well satisfy with their activities and services. Besides, results show that support for and satisfaction with vigilantisms are associated with environmental, social and economic characteristics of the residents in the community they serve. The thesis supported in this research paper is that public support for and satisfaction with vigilantisms can be influenced significantly through policing strategies that builds legitimacy.   Originality/value Vigilantism pervades contemporary policing strategies. It is supported by national crime prevention policies, according to the logic that the use of community self-help security strategies could contribute to sustainable crime prevention. This study extends research on legitimacy, with an empirical focus on Nigerian vigilantism. Understanding factors that shape public support for vigilantism may enhance safer communities.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-08-2017-0101?af=R","2018-07-10 08:17:16","54","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

                  <p>The &lsquo;sex offender&rsquo; is the subject of intense media focus, public attention, political manipulation, as well as psychological, sociological and correctional interest. He is categorized, classified and vilified by the public, the media, the psy-disciplines and through diverse correctional practices. This paper dissects the social construction of the &ldquo;sex offender&rdquo; category, examines the resultant problems for the abolitionist stance, and proposes a way to move the conversation forward. I conceptualize what engaging with the issue of sexual harm would look like from an abolitionist perspective and explore various initiatives such as Circles of Support and Accountability, and other promising initiatives that would work well for people who are likely to or who have sexually harmed.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10612-018-9406-y","2018-07-10 08:30:54","79","Critical Criminology"
"11626","Interpreting T-Statistics Under Publication Bias: Rough Rules of Thumb","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>A key issue is how to interpret t-statistics when publication bias is present. In this paper we propose a set of rough rules of thumb to assist readers to interpret t-values in published results under publication bias. Unlike most previous methods that utilize collections of studies, our approach evaluates the strength of evidence under publication bias when there is only a single study.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>We first re-interpret t-statistics in a one-tailed hypothesis test in terms of their associated p-values when there is extreme publication bias, that is, when no null findings are published. We then consider the consequences of different degrees of publication bias. We show that under even moderate levels of publication bias adjusting one&rsquo;s p-values to insure Type I error rates of either 0.05 or 0.01 result in far higher t-values than those in a conventional t-statistics table. Under a conservative assumption that publication bias occurs 20 percent of the time, with a one-tailed test at a significance level of 0.05, a t-value equal or greater than 2.311 is needed. For a two-tailed test the appropriate standard would be equal or above 2.766. Both cutoffs are far higher than the traditional ones of 1.645 and 1.96. To achieve a p-value less than 0.01, the adjusted t-values would be 2.865 (one-tail) and 3.254 (two-tail), as opposed to the traditional values 2.326 (one-tail) and 2.576 (two-tail). We illustrate our approach by applying it to evaluate the hypothesis tests in recent issues of <em>Criminology</em> and <em>Journal of Quantitative Criminology</em> (<em>JQC</em>).</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>Under publication bias much higher t-values are needed to restore the intended p-value. By comparing the observed test scores with the adjusted critical values, this paper provides a rough rule of thumb for readers to evaluate the degree to which a reported positive result in a single publication reflects a true positive effect. Further measures to increase the reporting of robust null findings are needed to ameliorate the issue of publication bias.</p>

                  <p>This study provides an evaluation of <em>the</em> major policy shift in sentencing practices over the past half-century &ndash; namely the shift from indeterminate to determinant sentencing policies and the use of sentencing guidelines. The theoretical literature on courtroom organization and focal concerns informs this evaluation of determinate sentencing practices in Florida. Drawing from prior theoretical and empirical research, hierarchical linear and generalized linear models are estimated to assess courtroom effects on individual level sentencing outcomes. The findings document that location matters when sentenced in Florida. Specifically, the likelihood of being sentenced to prison and the length of sentence varies across counties, even after controlling for individual case and offender characteristics and a variety of contextual characteristics. Additionally, the influence of legal and extra-legal factors on prison in/out and sentence length decisions varies significantly across counties. Several court characteristics, including court size, caseload pressure and trial rate assert direct influence on a county&rsquo;s likelihood of prison in/out and mean sentence length decisions.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12103-018-9444-8","2018-07-11 17:15:12","41","American Journal of Criminal Justice"

                  <p>The Domestic Violence Program Evaluation and Research Collaborative (DVPERC) was formed in Massachusetts in 2011 as an effort to connect research and practice. Initially, we consisted of a few programs and researchers, but we quickly evolved into a regional collaboration spanning several states. From the outset, we have followed community-based participatory research values, including co-learning, power sharing, and relationship-building. Several aspects of DVPERC make it unique. Our collaboration is informal, ongoing, and comprised of an array of programs, practitioners, and researchers. Although we are abundant in number, we are regional in scope, which allows for regular, in-person meetings. In this article, we describe the history of DVPERC, the five elements of the DVPERC model, and the model&rsquo;s inherent benefits and limitations. Throughout, we infuse our practitioner and researcher perspectives on DVPERC involvement. We hope our honest description of DVPERC assists others interested in launching their own CBPR practitioner-researcher partnerships.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-9978-z","2018-07-12 01:31:24","40","Journal of Family Violence"
"11647","Tombstone Towns and Toxic Prisons: Prison Ecology and the Necessity of An Anti-Prison Environmental Movement","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>Within the field of green criminology, scant attention has been paid to prison ecology, or the unique characteristics of the common environments of correctional facilities. As investigative reports by human rights and prison abolition organizations have highlighted, there is growing evidence to suggest a systemic pattern of prisoners being exposed to environmental injustices resulting from their proximity to federal Superfund and other contaminated sites. One of the most expensive Superfund sites in the Midwest, the former Velsicol Chemical Corporation plant site in St. Louis, Michigan has been contaminated with DDT, PBB and pCBSA. Located one and a half miles from the site is one of the State&rsquo;s largest correctional compounds- the Central Michigan and St. Louis Correctional facilities- which house more than 3500 prisoners who are disproportionately men of color. Despite multiple civil rights lawsuits filed by prisoners at the facility, little has been done to address the problems of water contamination at the prison. Furthermore, the failure of the Environmental Protection Agency to consider prisoners within federal environmental justice guidelines facilitates continued harm for this vulnerable population. Given the increasing revelations of toxic prisons across the U.S., it is necessary for environmentalists and green criminologists to work together with prison abolition organizations to fight the epidemic of toxic prisons.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10612-018-9399-6","2018-07-12 09:15:41","47","Critical Criminology"

                  <p>When considering abolition of the criminal justice system, there is no greater or more impactful relevance than for juveniles that find themselves inextricably linked to the juvenile justice system. From its inception, the philosophical foundation of juvenile care was to provide individualized, compassionate assistance to young men and women perceived to be in need of emotional care and/or social control. With the establishment of the Cook County Juvenile Court in 1899, the American juvenile justice system has endured a 118-year odyssey that has produced progressively rational, largely unsympathetic, and increasingly punitive practices. With happenings such as the &lsquo;school-to-prison pipeline&rsquo;, &lsquo;juvenile life without the possibility of parole&rsquo;, &lsquo;teen courts&rsquo;, and &lsquo;deferred prosecution probation&rsquo;, current juveniles that make unassuming mistakes and errors in judgment are adjoined to a system that sustains and reinforces itself through these mistakes and errors. The charge of this article is to recommend the abolition of the contemporary juvenile justice system, with safeguards for the protection from serious offenders and a return to the compassionate care that is warranted for the majority of juveniles that currently bolster the system.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10612-018-9402-2","2018-07-12 11:30:44","61","Critical Criminology"

                  <p>Past research links childhood exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV) to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), with preliminary evidence that white children may be more traumatized by IPV exposure than African American children. Despite this, few studies have explored the moderating effect of race/ethnicity on children&rsquo;s IPV exposure and subsequent trauma symptoms. Using a diverse sample of children in the U.S. child welfare system (<em>n</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;713) with high prevalence of IPV exposure, this study employs subpopulation analysis with multivariate regression to explore whether race/ethnicity moderates the relationship between IPV exposure and trauma symptoms, and whether differential predictors of trauma exist for white, African American, and Hispanic children exposed to IPV. Race/ethnicity moderates the relationship between childhood exposure to IPV and trauma, with Hispanic children exhibiting fewer trauma symptoms than white children as IPV exposure becomes more frequent. Differential predictors of trauma also emerged by child race/ethnicity. Caregiver&rsquo;s depression predicted white and African American children&rsquo;s trauma, while neighborhood quality predicted Hispanic children&rsquo;s trauma. This study suggests that race/ethnicity correlates with different risk factors for child welfare-supervised children and, as such, should be considered when designing and implementing interventions for this population.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-9976-1","2018-07-13 08:16:15","33","Journal of Family Violence"

"11731","Minority Threat, Community Disadvantage and Sentencing","Journal of Criminological Research, Policy and Practice, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose Prior studies of criminal sentencing have largely focused on individual-level predictors of sentencing outcomes. The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of a variety of theoretically derived community measurements of social threat and disadvantage on the criminal sentencing of convicted felons. This analysis permits an evaluation of whether legal ideals such as equality before the law and policy goals of equal treatment for like offenders are achieved.   Design/methodology/approach The study examines data of individuals sentenced in the state of Florida and community level measurements of racial and ethnic threat and community disadvantage. Hierarchical generalized linear model is used to analyze the effect of these measures on the dichotomous in/out imprisonment variable, and standard hierarchical linear regression analysis is used to model the continuous dependent variable of sentence length.   Findings The results provide support for the racial threat perspective though not for ethnic threat nor community disadvantage. The findings and their implications are discussed in terms of theory, research and policy.   Practical implications Racial disparity in criminal justice practices is receiving increasing public and policy attention, as evidenced by the growing Black Lives Matter movement. Regarding sentencing, racial disparity remains a major research and policy question. While the current research and theoretical literature on sentencing is not conclusive, it is clear that race matters. As a result, racial disparity in sentencing needs to be a priority in subsequent â€œtransitional criminologyâ€ efforts between researchers and policy makers to identify, explain and ultimately predict exactly how race impacts sentencing, and how to reduce it as a consideration from sentencing.   Originality/value This study contributes to a growing body of literature that examines the social context of punishments by using several community level measurements of threat and disadvantage, while modeling the two-step sentencing outcome of imprisonment and sentence length.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JCRPP-02-2018-0009?af=R","2018-07-17 08:16:11","62","Journal of Criminological Research, Policy and Practice"
"11732","Officer Views in Contracting, Merger, and Hybrid Agencies","Policing: An International Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose The purpose of this paper is to assess officer perceptions of consolidation of law enforcement agencies under three specific models: contracting, merger and a hybrid of regionalization and contracting.   Design/methodology/approach A survey was administered to 139 officers employed by four agencies using one of the models of interest. The survey asked officers their views on consolidation and how it has affected organizational and employment characteristics.   Findings Officers generally support consolidation, but views vary by agency type. Officers in the contracting agencies, for example, generally viewed consolidation as less cost effective than officers in other agencies viewed it, but were more likely to say crime decreased and job security and workload improved after consolidation. Officers in the hybrid agency were less positive about changes in some employment and organizational characteristics.   Research limitations/implications The sample size and response rates are low, and no comparison to other agencies is available, but the examination offers new information and lessons.   Practical implications Communities considering police consolidation must consider a specific model and how to communicate changes to officers. This research illuminates officer perspectives on each.   Originality/value This is the first investigation of views of shared services by specific model of consolidation. Such work is particularly valuable given increased interest in consolidation in recent years.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-03-2018-0034?af=R","2018-07-17 08:16:53","43","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"
"11733","Detention Or Diversion? the Influence of Training and Education on School Police Officer Discretion","Policing: An International Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose The growing concern about school violence and security has led to a dramatic increase in the number of police officers working in schools. This increase has been accompanied by a focus on the training of school-based law enforcement, the discretion that they exercise when interacting with youth, and the concern that these factors may lead to more youths facing arrest and formal processing by the juvenile and criminal justice system. What is not well understood is whether or not having formal school resource officer (SRO) training or higher education impacts the officerâ€™s decision making when responding to an incident involving a student. The paper aims to discuss these issues.   Design/methodology/approach This paper uses survey data from school police officers within the USA (n=179) to examine the officerâ€™s preferred post-incident method of disciplining the youth, from the most punitive and formal approach of suspension or referral to juvenile authorities, to the less punitive and informal approach such as diversion or warn and release.   Findings Overall, the study found that officers who have received formal SRO training were more likely to prefer a formal resolution to the incidents, and more highly educated officers tended to favor less punitive and informal responses.   Originality/value These findings question the current state of the effectiveness of SRO training at using diversionary tactics for conflict resolution in a school setting.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-01-2018-0007?af=R","2018-07-17 08:16:53","35","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"
"11734","Scaling Up Or Scaling Back? the Pitfalls and Possibilities of Leveraging Federal Interventions For Abolition","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>Antiprison activists have often turned the federal court system to reduce the violence of the carceral state. However, such reform attempts have too often had the unintended consequence of fortifying the penal system. In this article, I interrogate one such intervention&mdash;a federal court order that encompassed the Louisiana Department of Corrections from 1975 to 1998. I argue that while the lawsuit was declared a success in reforming Angola, the federal court&rsquo;s intervention buttressed and legitimated the growth of the Louisiana penal system. This paradox was produced through the limits of liberal reform ideology that failed to recognize the structural violence of incarceration. Rather, the federal courts located violence with prisoners instead of the punitive power of the state and racial capitalism. This framework not only led to an increase in punitive practices within Angola, it came to underpin penal expansion as the primary solution to cyclical overcrowding.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10612-018-9401-3","2018-07-17 09:15:39","23","Critical Criminology"

"11739","Measuring the Effect of Body-Worn Cameras on Complaints in Latin America","Policing: An International Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose More than a half a dozen published studies have observed the effect of body-worn cameras (BWCs) on complaints against the police. Nearly all, with varying degrees of methodological sophistication, tell a similar story: a strong reduction in complaints filed against the police once BWCs are in use. However, the entirety of the published evidence comes from English speaking countries, limited to the USA and the UK, and is restricted to the effects of BWCs on response policing. The purpose of this paper is to extend this body of research to Latin America, and to specialized policing jobs.   Design/methodology/approach The authors measured the consequence of equipping traffic police officers with BWCs in five out of the 19 traffic police departments in Uruguay (n=208), and compared these settings to both the pre-test figures as well as to the non-treatment departments. Interrupted time-series analyses and repeated measures of analysis were used for significance testing.   Findings Statistically significant differences emerged between the beforeâ€“after as well as the betweenâ€“groups comparisons: complaints were five times higher in the comparison vs the treatment jurisdictions, and there were 86 percent fewer cases compared to the pre-treatment period.   Research limitations/implications These outcomes suggest that the effect of BWCs on complaints is ubiquitous.   Practical implications The findings indicate that BWCs provide an effective solution for reducing grievances against the police, which can potentially be a marker of increased accountability, transparency and legitimacy for the Latin American law enforcement departments.   Originality/value This study is an extension of findings on BWCs to non-English-speaking police departments, with a focus on specialized policing rather than patrol policing.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-01-2018-0004?af=R","2018-07-18 08:18:04","68","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

"11751","â€˜disband, Disempower, and Disarmâ€™: Amplifying the Theory and Practice of Police Abolition","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>Critical criminologists have challenged the utility of efforts to reform the criminal justice system for decades, including strong calls to abolish the prison system. More recently, the rebellions in Ferguson, Baltimore, Milwaukee, and Charlotte have made racialized police violence and police reform issues of national concern. In this article, we examine abolitionist claims <em>aimed at law enforcement institutions</em> in the aftermath of Ferguson and other subsequent rebellions. We consider the implications for abolitionist organizing when the institution of law enforcement, rather than prisons, becomes the explicit target of our movement(s). How are groups theorizing and practicing police abolition and how does this align with, challenge, or expand past conceptualizations of abolition? To answer this question, first we sketch the broad parameters of abolitionist thought, particularly as it is taken up in the disciplines of political theory and criminology. Second, we analyze an emergent praxis of police abolition that revolves around the call to <em>disband, disempower, and disarm</em> law enforcement institutions. We argue that by attacking the police as an institution, by challenging its very right to exist, the contemporary abolitionist movement contains the potential to radically transform society. In this spirit, we amplify abolitionist praxis that (1) aims directly at the police as an institution, (2) seeks to dismantle the racial capitalist order, (3) adopts uncompromising positions that resist liberal attempts at co-optation, incorporation, and/or reconciliation, and (4) creates alterative democratic spaces that directly challenge the legitimacy of the police.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10612-018-9400-4","2018-07-20 08:30:44","68","Critical Criminology"

                    <p>Trials reports are frequently incomplete and inconsistent with their protocol. The most commonly practiced biased reporting practices are added outcomes not prespecified on the protocol, insufficiently pre-specifying outcomes, and omitting outcomes that were pre-specified on the protocol. There is a linear trend between the number of different biased reporting practices the trialist(s) engaged in and mean study-level Cohen&rsquo;s d (+&thinsp;0.214 with each additional type of biased reporting practice). Trials with omitted pre-specified outcomes have a significantly higher Cohen&rsquo;s d on average when compared to trials that did not omit such outcomes (+&thinsp;0.315). Added outcomes have a Cohen&rsquo;s d that is 0.385 higher in comparison to reported outcomes that were pre-specified on the protocol.</p>

However, there are no evidence-based TDV prevention interventions designed for afterschool, community-based settings with middle-school youth, in high-risk neighborhoods. Start Strong Boston (SSB) is a model that fills all three gaps, founded on partnerships between the Boston Public Health Commission, community afterschool sites, academic experts and evaluators, and youth. Here, we describe the SSB program and discuss how this collaboration built upon successes of this peer-engaged intervention, by developing and implementing a youth participatory action research (YPAR) evaluation study of SSB. Use of the YPAR framework tested the feasibility of employing Peer Researchers in an interdisciplinary evaluation team.

                  <p>Online hate is becoming a growing public concern, but so far, the phenomenon has not been studied from the perspective of fear of crime. This study examined why some people are disquieted more by hateful online content than others. The data consist of Finnish participants (<em>n</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;1726) between 15 and 30&nbsp;years old. The main analysis focused on participants who had seen online hate content during the past 3&nbsp;months. The feeling of being disturbed by this type of material is, in this article, operationalized with the concept of disquiet referring to a feeling of anxiety or uneasiness. The findings, based on ordinary least-squares regression analysis (OLS), show that the intensity of such negative experiences was stronger for women, immigrants, and those who had faced previous online and offline victimization. Risk-takers were less likely to be disquieted by online hate. In addition, those worrying about becoming online hate victims were more disquieted by online hate than others. The findings emphasize that online hate content may have a strong impact on those who are already in a vulnerable position. Overall, the study supports the idea that online and offline worlds are not two separate realities but rather coexisting dimensions of one social sphere.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10610-018-9393-2","2018-07-22 04:15:56","48","European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research"

                  <p>This article critically examines legislative reforms to the &lsquo;character test&rsquo;, related changes to policy and government administration, with a particular focus on the recent introduction and enforcement of an unprecedented regime of mandatory visa cancellation for non-citizens considered to be of bad character. Non-citizens subject to mandatory visa cancellation include those possessing a &lsquo;substantial criminal record&rsquo;. These individuals are subject to extended periods of imprisonment after the expiration of non-parole periods, or lengthy periods of immigration detention upon the expiration of their prison sentence. They are vulnerable to removal from Australia notwithstanding deep and enduring community ties. Justified by politicians as a measure of effective crime control, visa cancellations on the grounds of bad character have increased rapidly since 2014, largely as a consequence of the introduction of mandatory visa cancellation.

"11844","Sorry, Wrong Number: Tracking Court Attendance Targeting Through Testing A â€œNudgeâ€ Text","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Research Question</h3>
                    <p>Will sending defendants text messages reminding them that they are due at court, the day before, cause more defendants to attend the first scheduled Magistrate&rsquo;s Court hearing?</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Data</h3>
                    <p>The study universe included all 946 defendants in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight sent a postal requisition requiring them to attend court, who also had a mobile phone number, between January and June 2017. Two outcomes were then tracked: court attendance and fail-to-appear warrants.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Method</h3>
                    <p>The experiment randomly assigned defendants at the point of postal requisition creation into the control group (<em>n</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;472), which received the standard postal approach, or the experimental treatment group (<em>n</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;474), which was sent a prescribed text message on the day before the court appearance. An intention to treat methodology was adopted, with a treatment integrity rate of 97% achieved. Post-experimental phone calls tracked the accuracy of 300 of the text numbers used across both experimental and control groups.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Findings</h3>
                    <p>No statistically significant effect of text messages was found on either attendance at court (OR 1.06, <em>p</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.661) or fail-to-appear warrants issued (OR 1.106, <em>p</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.512). Sub-group moderator analyses were conducted by age, distance from home to court, prior history of failure to appear, and investigator contact with defendants. No sub-group showed statistically significant differences in either outcome. The post-experimental survey of phone number quality in a random sample of 300 numbers from both groups found 62% were either invalid (uncontactable) or confirmed as not being valid for the defendant. Reanalysis limited to the sub-sample of the 112 accurate numbers found that text messages had produced a promising but non-significant boost in court attendance rates.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>&ldquo;Nudge Texts&rdquo; may be able to boost court attendance, but only if the accuracy of phone numbers used is assured in advance of sending the text messages.</p>

                  <p>This article focuses on the perspectives of young ethnic minorities in the Nordic countries who have experienced various forms of &ldquo;police stops&rdquo;, i.e. situations where the police stop them without any reference to a specific event of which the youth are aware. Analytically, the debate is positioned through an intersectionality approach of (un)belonging to majority societies. Across the Nordic countries, we found that the young people described five social markers as reasons for being stopped, namely clothing, hanging out in groups, ethnicity, neighbourhoods and gender. We argue that the police stops explicate how the young men in particular are often forced to think about themselves in terms of &ldquo;a threat&rdquo; to the majority and the attributes they have that make them seem like criminals.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10612-018-9408-9","2018-07-24 03:15:35","36","Critical Criminology"

                  <p>Intimate partner violence (IPV) is an issue of global concern and there is a dearth of research into the culture-specific barriers that migrant women in Australia face. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which migrant women in Australia experience IPV, and to understand the factors that influence their help-seeking behavior. One hundred and thirty migrant women from the continents of Asia, Europe, South America, North America and Africa aged between 19 and 65&nbsp;years (<em>M</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;38.15&nbsp;years) reported their experiences of IPV and their preparedness to seek assistance through surveys. The results showed that over 50% of the participants experienced some form of IPV, with the most common type being verbal and emotional, followed by physical and psychological, and then financial. Most women indicated that they needed help, however, many refrained from seeking it; a range of barriers influenced their decision to not seek assistance. The findings have implications for future studies examining violence against culturally and linguistically diverse minority women, the barriers in them seeking assistance and their main sources of support.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-9980-5","2018-07-24 19:31:19","64","Journal of Family Violence"

                  <p>This article summarizes key points made in a session at the American Society of Criminology meeting in Philadelphia in November 2017, entitled &ldquo;The replication issue in science and its relevance for criminology&rdquo;, organized by Friedrich L&ouml;sel and Robert F. Boruch. In turn, this session was inspired by Friedrich L&ouml;sel&rsquo;s (<span>2018</span>) article in this journal, based on his 2015 Joan McCord Award Lecture of the Academy of Experimental Criminology. In the present article, Friedrich L&ouml;sel introduces the topic of replication in criminology and summarizes his main arguments. Then, six leading criminologists present short papers on this topic. Robert F. Boruch points out the instability in social systems, David P. Farrington argues that systematic reviews are important, and Denise C. Gottfredson calls attention to the heterogeneity in conclusions across different studies. Lorraine Mazerolle reviews attempts to replicate experiments in procedural justice, Lawrence W. Sherman draws attention to enthusiasm bias in criminal justice experiments, and David Weisburd discusses the logic of null hypothesis significance testing and multi-center trials. Finally, some developments since November 2017 in research on replication in criminology are discussed.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11292-018-9337-3","2018-07-25 10:31:58","88","Journal of Experimental Criminology"

                  <p>In this paper, we attempt to determine if the psychometric features of the 11-scenario survey designed by Klockars et al. provide valid results for survey responses concerning police integrity and ethics. To do this, we used the multi-facet Rash statistical model on two samples from police respondents in two different countries (one in North America and the other in Continental Europe). Our results demonstrate that the survey, when combined with a specific statistical model, was able to assess the level of integrity of police officers in these two different samples. We conclude that the 11-scenario survey and the methodology we have developed can be considered very robust and is therefore useful for managerial purposes, particularly in candidate selection and promotion.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9287-8","2018-07-26 05:16:48","38","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"

This increase has run parallel to a decrease in the general policing budget, which has seen it cut by an average of 22% across England and Wales [BBC. (2017). Utilizing data from observations and in-depth qualitative interviews with police officers from a force in England, this article highlights the effect which cost-saving measures have had on the professional standards of the police service in the management of sex offenders; how collaborative working practices have been hindered by these austerity measures, and finally how continual cuts have had a detrimental effect on the police&rsquo;s ability to protect the public.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay047/5060033?rss=1","2018-07-26 15:02:04","44","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"

                  <p>Literature supports the impact of intimate partner violence (IPV) on women&rsquo;s short and long-term material hardship; yet, little research has examined the role of civil legal services in addressing women&rsquo;s economic self-sufficiency. Using survey data from a sample of low-income women seeking civil legal services related to IPV, we examined changes in women&rsquo;s economic self-sufficiency over a one-year period of time. The sample consisted of women who were experiencing IPV and receiving assistance with a civil protective order (CPO) or a family law problem. Eighty-five women completed three waves of data collected, baseline and every six months, over a period of one year. Nearly two-thirds of the women received assistance for a CPO (<em>n</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;56); the rest were represented in a family law matter. Approximately 45% of women lived in non-metro/rural areas (<em>n</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;38). Measures of economic self-sufficiency included income, use of public assistance<strong>,</strong> adequacy of family resources, and perceptions of the difficulty living off their current income. Women&rsquo;s monthly income and adequacy of some family resources increased, while difficulty living on their current income and the number of assistance resources used decreased (Wave 1 to 3). There was no relation between the type or amount of legal services received and changes in study outcomes. Study findings suggest that civil legal services are a critical component of a community coordinated response to IPV.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-9977-0","2018-07-27 10:16:24","42","Journal of Family Violence"

                  <p>Previous research has studied effective self-protective behaviors, such as a victim&rsquo;s physical resistance leading to the avoidance of sexual victimization. However, there are few studies on effective self-protective behavioral sequences, such as an offender&rsquo;s physical violence followed by the victim&rsquo;s physical resistance. Our study aims to clarify these sequences through a supervised machine learning approach. The samples consisted of 88 official documents on sexual assaults involving women, committed by male offenders incarcerated in a Japanese local prison. These crimes were classified as completed or attempted cases based on judges&rsquo; evaluations. All phrases in each crime description were also partitioned and coded according to the Japanese Penal Code. The support vector machine identified the most likely sequences of behaviors to predict completed and attempted cases. Approximately 90% of cases were correctly predicted through the identification of behavior sequences. The sequence involving an offender&rsquo;s violence followed by the victim&rsquo;s physical resistance predicted attempted sexual assault. However, the sequence involving a victim&rsquo;s general resistance followed by the offender&rsquo;s violence predicted completed sexual assault. Victims&rsquo; and offender&rsquo;s behaviors need to be interpreted from behavioral sequence perspectives rather than a single action perspective. The supervised machine learning methodologies may extract self-protective behavioral sequences in documents more effectively than other methodologies. The self-protective sequence is a fundamental part of resistance during sexual assault. Training focused on protective sequence contributes to the improvement of resistance training and rape avoidance rates.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11417-018-9273-1","2018-07-27 13:00:18","48","Asian Journal of Criminology"

"11916","The Association Between Distinct Categories of Child Abuse Experiences and Dating Violence in Early Adolescence","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>Recent studies have shown significant associations between child maltreatment experiences and adolescent dating violence (ADV). However, few have investigated whether these associations differ by type of violence. The present study examined whether associations with four different ADV subgroups differed by the type of child maltreatment experienced. In total, 2934 7th grade students aged 12&ndash;15 (M&thinsp;=&thinsp;13.5, SD&thinsp;=&thinsp;.5) filled out questionnaires at school. Logistic regression models which included eight potential confounding variables including gender, low SES, parenting styles as well as four forms of child abuse (i.e. emotional, physical, and sexual abuse, witnessing domestic violence), were performed to assess the impact of child maltreatment on the likelihood that the students would either be a victim or perpetrator of four distinct ADV subgroups (i.e. emotional only, physical, sexual only, multiple). Child sexual abuse was by far the strongest predictor of ADV, with odds ratios of 3.44 to 43.41. The remaining maltreatment types were associated with different types of ADV to varying degrees. The findings indicate a complex interaction between child maltreatment and ADV. To fully understand the complexity of the transmission of violence, further research on associations between subcategories of child maltreatment and ADV is suggested. More detailed knowledge on different child maltreatment experiences in relation to ADV would enable more specific targeting in future prevention programs aimed at reducing ADV.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-9979-y","2018-07-28 00:31:17","32","Journal of Family Violence"

                  <span>
                    <h3>Purpose</h3>
                    <p>Despite the asserted importance of community reentry as part of the pathway to desistance, there is relatively little empirical research examining the role of custody experiences and a young person&rsquo;s personal transformation while incarcerated. With the increasing emphasis on service delivery within Canadian facilities, it is possible that some aspects of custody help facilitate desistance, but research has yet to clarify which specific aspects are important.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>Guided by rational choice, life course, and cognitive transformation perspectives on desistance, the current study addressed this question by examining the impact of various custody experiences and transformations on short- and longer-term offending outcomes for a sample of incarcerated male and female youth (<em>n</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;217). The reliable change index was used to examine changes in self-identity between admission to custody and the weeks prior to release.</p>

                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>Short- versus longer-term offending outcomes were influenced by different custody experiences and the importance of identity change varied across these different outcomes.</p>

                  <p>This study investigates the predictors of four types of cybercrime victimization/experiences: online harassment, hacking, identity theft, and receiving nude photos or explicit content. The effects of victimization opportunity and low self-control are examined as the primary independent variables in logistic regression analyses of data collected from a large sample of undergraduates enrolled at two universities in the United States. Results suggest that opportunity is positively related to each of the four types of online victimization, and that low self-control is associated with person-based, but not computer-based, forms of cybercrime. These findings speak to the utility, and also the limitations, of these perspectives in understanding cybercrime victimization risk among college students, and to the potentially criminogenic nature of the Internet.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12103-018-9447-5","2018-07-28 11:15:13","68","American Journal of Criminal Justice"

                  <p>Knowledge about trafficking in human beings has several implications for various social service and justice professionals. The aim of this study was to examine the knowledge of social service and justice professionals regarding the characterization of this phenomenon and anti-trafficking policies in Portugal. Four hundred and forty-six social service and justice professionals completed an online Human Trafficking Knowledge survey. The results revealed that Portuguese professionals have, in general, a good level of knowledge about trafficking in human beings, revealing higher-level scores for issues, such as trafficking in human beings&rsquo; idiosyncrasies and purposes in Portugal, trafficker profiles, criminal behaviour, victim profiles and victimization dynamics. On the other hand, participants scored lower in trafficking in human being&rsquo;s trajectories and specificities within Portugal. This knowledge appeared to be influenced by variables, such as professional experience, previous contact with trafficking and training in trafficking in human beings. National policies must promote professional formal training about trafficking in human beings in different areas.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10610-018-9394-1","2018-07-28 12:45:49","33","European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research"

                  <p>This article proposes new approaches to sexual violence prevention on college and university campuses in the United States. The author conducted four thought experiments about possible college sexual assault prevention strategies based on personal experience with campus administrators and sexual assault prevention specialists, review of existing research, and conversation with undergraduates and graduate students engaged in sexual assault prevention. Both advantages and drawbacks of each potential new strategy were contemplated. The four thought experiments were: (1) What if campuses stopped investing in sexual assault prevention and invested in fighting structural oppression instead?; (2) What if the mission to change social norms was not limited to campus, but aimed at the macro level?; (3) What if sexual assault prevention experts were trained in consent and pleasure related to kink, anal sex, and group sex?; and (4) What if colleges and universities provided on-campus education and counseling options for people who perpetrate sexual assault? First, encouraging a &ldquo;root cause&rdquo; perspective on sexual assault prevention would be strategic and socially responsible, but might be difficult to enact. Second, social norms change strategies that are global, not local, might be effective but might require an unrealistic level of cooperation between schools. Third, more information about consent as it pertains to kink, anal sex, and group sex may be useful components of sexual assault prevention education. Finally, there are too few evidence-based programs for people who have perpetrated sexual assault on campuses. Thought experiments are inexpensive to conduct and may invigorate the field.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-9982-3","2018-07-28 15:31:13","59","Journal of Family Violence"

                  <span>
                    <h3>Purpose</h3>
                    <p>This paper argues that cyber-dependent offending differs in important ways from other types of offending, which poses challenges to established life-course criminological explanations. Moreover, this study examines to what extent life circumstances in both private and professional life are differentially related to cyber-offending and traditional offending.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>This study analyzes longitudinal registration data of all adults who have been at least once suspected of a cybercrime (<em>N</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;870) and/or a traditional crime (<em>N</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;1,144,740) in the Netherlands during the period of 2000&ndash;2012. Using fixed effects panel models, within-person effects of household composition, employment, and enrollment in education on the likelihood of cyber-offending are compared with those for traditional offending.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>Similar results are found with respect to individual&rsquo;s private lives. An individual is less likely to commit cybercrime as well as traditional crime in years in which that individual shares a household with a partner, whether with or without children, than in other years. For the professional life, several important differences are found. Employment and enrollment in education are not statistically significantly related to cyber-offending, whereas they reduce the likelihood of traditional offending. In fact, for these professional life circumstances, opposite effects are found in this population.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>This first study to empirically compare cyber-offending and traditional offending over the life-course finds important similarities and differences. The results hint at the importance of possible cybercriminal opportunities provided by otherwise preventive professional life circumstances.</p>

                  <p>The corruption activities of the Kenya police are conducted primarily through syndicates run by superior officers. Police corruption crime has emerged as a serious &ldquo;crime problem&rdquo; in Kenya, perhaps not surprisingly given its reputation as being one of the most corrupt nations in the world. In countries where police corruption is persistent, such as Kenya, it represents a systemic failure of governance where the principal institutions responsible for ensuring police accountability, the observance of ethics and integrity standards, and enforcing the rule of law are compromised and themselves infested with corrupt individuals and syndicates. This work discusses and analyzes the trends and magnitude of police corruption crime in Kenya drawing on available data and providing detailed analysis to show a coherent picture of the police corruption problem and its environmental/situational determinants in the country within the current policing institutional framework.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1057/s41284-018-0149-y","2018-08-02 15:17:25","65","Security Journal"

                  <p>There are various critiques laid out against the framework of carceral abolition (as it appears currently in prison abolition and deinstitutionalization): that it is abstract, only critiques but does not suggest specific solutions; that it is a utopian vision of the world; and that it is unrealistic in the world we currently occupy. Throughout this article I will demonstrate how such critiques can be conceptualized as strengths of these movements and frameworks for liberation. I argue that carceral abolition (as it appears in prison abolition and deinstitutionalization) is a form of knowledge, an ethical position. My first claim is that this knowledge is rooted in maroonage and I show the consequences of not engaging with abolition from intersectional frameworks. My second claim is that we can understand abolition as a dis-epistemology that rejects ways of knowing tied to certainty, optimism and certain notions of futurity and temporality.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10612-018-9403-1","2018-08-03 03:15:48","43","Critical Criminology"

"12011","Tradecraft to Standardsâ€”moving Criminal Intelligence Practice to A Profession Through the Development of A Criminal Intelligence Training and Development Continuum","<span><div>Abstract</div>Australian governments, academia, and law enforcement agencies have recognized the need to improve intelligence capabilities in order to adapt to the increasingly complex criminal and security environments. In response, the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission (ACIC), the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and other Australian policing agencies have adopted several reform measures to improve intelligence capability support. While some have focused on developing specific criminal intelligence doctrine, others have sought to improve more challenging aspects of intelligence capability such as analytical and field collection workforce planning. The complexity of the current and emerging criminal environment and a growing professionalization of policing practice more broadly has resulted in a uniquely new strategic approach to developing the analytical and field collection workforce. This article surveys the development of an Australian Criminal Intel Training and Development Continuum (CITDC). The continuum is an end-to-end continuing professional development framework for criminal intelligence analysts and field intelligence officers that monitor proficiency, competence, and knowledge achievement through pre-entry aptitude testing, rigorous class room, and workplace mentoring. The continuum is designed at the post-graduate level and articulates with Charles Sturt University&rsquo;s MA (Intelligence Analysis). The article argues that both the philosophy of rigorous standards and the learning underpinning the continuum are having demonstrable and positive outcomes for intelligence practitioners and the investigative workforce they support.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay053/5067356?rss=1","2018-08-06 16:47:11","93","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"
"12012","Experiencing Organizational Change During An Era of Reform: Police Scotland, Narratives of Localism, and Perceptions From the â€˜frontlineâ€™","<span><div>Abstract</div>In 2011, the Scottish Government took the decision to create a single, national police force, reconfiguring a structure of regional police forces, which had prevailed since the 19th century. Despite a strong narrative around localism in the legislation establishing Police Scotland, the new force that was established in 2013 quickly found itself at the centre of a debate around an emerging &lsquo;crisis of localism&rsquo; as critics expressed concerns over the centralization of decision-making and a lack of sensitivity to local contexts. Drawing on qualitative research carried out in four communities across Scotland in 2016, the analysis presented in this article examines the experience of organizational change from the perspective of officers in local policing teams and from local stakeholders. The analysis is structured around the strategic aims of reform of improved local service delivery, more equal local access to specialist expertise, and enhanced connections with local communities. The article highlights the sense of exclusion from the decision-making surrounding the organizational changes associated with the implementation of reform experienced by local, rank-and-file officers.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay052/5067353?rss=1","2018-08-06 16:47:11","107","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"

Recently, Bangladeshi policing has been criticized for abductions and forced disappearances. The empirical analysis of this article focuses on the key factors and dynamics of abductions and disappearances in Bangladeshi policing. This article also investigates how and why the law enforcement agencies in Bangladesh are engaged in abductions and disappearances based on interviews of different stakeholders. The empirical parts of the article employ qualitative techniques of data analysis in order to process the body of evidence collected during the fieldwork. The key argument of this article is that the acute politicization of the law enforcement agencies and misuse of entrusted power implementing the political agenda of the ruling elite contribute to human rights violations in policing practice in Bangladesh.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay051/5067355?rss=1","2018-08-06 16:47:11","52","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"

A comparison with German and Swiss law shows that the requirement of the presence of a detriment to the prosecuting state is rather common than an exemption. In fact, among those three countries only the Austrian and Swiss laws criminalize espionage against foreign states based on their neutrality statuses. In particular, a comparison of the statistics draws further attention to the striking imbalance of convictions for espionage against foreign states between Switzerland and Austria, despite the repeated claim of Austria being a hot spot of international espionage activities. Although no final answer can be reached, the article seeks to give possible responses to this contradiction.</div>","http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/15718174-02603002","2018-08-07 06:15:45","29","European Journal of Crime, Criminal Law and Criminal Justice"

Consequently, banks become <i xmlns=""http://pub2web.metastore.ingenta.com/ns/"">de facto</i> extensions of law enforcement.

                  <p>In recent years, the Darknet has become one of the most discussed topics in cyber security circles. Current academic studies and media reports tend to highlight how the anonymous nature of the Darknet is used to facilitate criminal activities. This paper reports on a recent research in four Darknet forums that reveals a different aspect of the Darknet. Drawing on our qualitative findings, we suggest that many users of the Darknet might not perceive it as intrinsically criminogenic, despite their acknowledgement of various kinds of criminal activity in this network. Further, our research participants emphasised on the achievement of constructive socio-political values through the use of the Darknet. This achievement is enabled by various characteristics that are rooted in the Darknet&rsquo;s technological structure, such as anonymity, privacy, and the use of cryptocurrencies. These characteristics provide a wide range of opportunities for good as well as for evil.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1057/s41284-018-0150-5","2018-08-07 15:17:46","45","Security Journal"

                  <p>The role that food corporations have in determining our health and nutrition is concomitant with the power and influence that corporations exercise across all commercial sectors. These large, powerful, and often multinational entities &ndash; collectively referred to as Big Food &ndash; employ a robust array of strategies to advance the organizational interests associated with a seemingly paradoxical business model: securing the continuous and ever-growing consumption of food products increasingly associated with negative health outcomes. As this model proliferates globally, the implications of this contradiction warrant specific attention to the activities of Big Food corporations through a critical criminological framework. The pervasive and increasingly legitimized activity of Big Food relies on a legal, regulatory, and moral framework that allows for the relegation of all non-market oriented value systems to be secondary to a pro-corporatist ideological and moral superstructure. Whereas previous scholarship has contributed to an understanding of what occurs when profit-maximization values collide with &ndash; and then co-opt &ndash; public health and nutrition interests, the present study offers a spectrum-based theory to explain how various degrees of food fraud are systematically incentivized by the legal privileges of corporations and the hegemonic moral economy of neoliberal governance.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10611-018-9787-6","2018-08-08 07:15:27","52","Crime, Law and Social Change"

The purpose of this paper is to examine the obstacles confronted by this program over its implementation.   Design/methodology/approach Data were collected through 20 semi-structured interviews conducted with members of the Uruguay National Police selected via purposeful sampling. The study relies on a grounded theory approach. Findings were interpreted based on five categories of analysis.   Findings Findings point at obstacles confronted by the program associated with contextual organizational factors, a general misunderstanding of POP, leadership, resistance and motivation, and availability and sufficiency of resources.   Originality/value Although POP has been implemented in a variety of settings, it is still rare in Latin America. As a consequence, research on POP is limited in this region. This study adds to the small but growing body of literature on the police reform in Latin America, and at the same time, is one the few pieces of research on the police reform in Uruguay.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-02-2018-0025?af=R","2018-08-09 08:32:03","107","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

Design/methodology/approach A survey based on a random sample of 514 male and female police officers was conducted, and multivariate regression was employed to assess the effects of demands and resources on work stress and work engagement.   Findings Familyâ€“work conflicts, organizational and operational factors affected work stress and work engagement among police officers. Constructive coping was found to be positively related to work stress and negatively associated with work engagement.   Research limitations/implications Survey data collected from a single Chinese city may not be generalized to officers in other parts of China or Chinese societies with different social and political contexts.   Originality/value The present study filled the knowledge gap about factors influencing police stress and engagement. This study provides insights into how to establish relevant contextual measures to reduce police work stress. This study represents one of the first attempts to use a random sample of police officers for the investigation of police stress in Hong Kong.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-01-2018-0015?af=R","2018-08-09 08:32:03","52","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"
"12039","Racialized Perceptions of the Police","Policing: An International Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine differences in latent structures/dimensions in public perceptions of the police by race/ethnicity and level of identification with a given race/ethnic group.   Design/methodology/approach To identify differences in dimensions of juvenilesâ€™ perceptions of the police by the sub-samples, factor analyses were conducted utilizing data from the Gang Resistance Education and Training program evaluation.   Findings The results show that minority juveniles have a relatively fragmented dimensional structure for the construct of perceptions of the police, while white juveniles have a unidimensional structure. Furthermore, moderate within-group differences in structures were found among Africanâ€“American juveniles.   Research limitations/implications The results of the current study call for further examination of racial invariant assumptions in criminology. Since individual dimensions constituting perceptions of the police vary by race/ethnicity, those dimensions may potentially have unique associations with endogenous variables (e.g. criminality and cooperation with the police) according to individualsâ€™ racial/ethnic membership.   Practical implications Police should clearly understand individualsâ€™ dimensions constituting perceptions of the police and should identify dimensions that greatly impact precursors to compliance and cooperation with police such as perceived police legitimacy or perceived risk of sanction.   Originality/value Individualsâ€™ dimensions constituting perceptions of the police have significant implications on the construction of measures and their associations with other variables; however, racial differences in these dimensions have not been explored since Sullivan et al.â€™s (1987) research about three decades ago. In addition, the current study examined within-race differences in the dimensions constituting perceptions of the police.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-11-2017-0144?af=R","2018-08-09 08:32:03","44","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

                  <span>
                    <h3>Objectives</h3>
                    <p>We analyze the contribution of changes in the black&ndash;white racial disparity in imprisonment to changes in the black incarceration rate. We also describe the behavior of the racial disparity across states and across time.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>We use state level incarceration data for non-Hispanic black and white males to perform a decomposition of the black incarceration rate. This allows us to attribute changes in black incarceration to changes in the racial disparity and changes in the overall incarceration rate. We use a Fourier approximation to identify structural change points for the racial disparity at both the state and national level.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>The large increase in black imprisonment between 1978 and 1999 was driven by increases in the overall rate of imprisonment, while the smaller decrease which occurred between 1999 and 2014 was driven by reductions in the black&ndash;white racial disparity. For many states, the racial disparity increased starting in the mid-1980s, where this increase may have been linked to the crack epidemic. Many states experienced a downturn in the racial disparity starting in the 1990s. Whatever its other effects, this suggests that the 1994 crime bill did not aggravate the preexisting racial disparity in imprisonment. California&rsquo;s experience has been strongly counter to national trends with a large increase in the racial disparity beginning in the early 1990s and continuing until near the end of our sample.</p>

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>While the racial disparity in imprisonment has been falling since 1996, it remains quite high as of 2014. Future work is required to better understand the policy determinants of this disparity.</p>

In this article, we analyse temporal patterns of calls for police service relating to mental health. Approximately, 22,000 mental health-related calls are analysed. Seasonal, monthly, and daily patterns are analysed using ANOVA and negative binomial regression. Mental health-related calls for police service have a distinct temporal pattern for the days of the week and, to a lesser extent, at different times of the year. These calls for police service are elevated during fall/winter months and during the week. Our analyses show that police resourcing based only on criminal activity is limited for at least this one form of police calls for service. This may have implications for police resourcing and scheduling, particularly in the context of the day of the week and when special mental health teams are needed.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay060/5071717?rss=1","2018-08-11 16:01:58","126","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"

This article will argue that legislative reform should codify a minimal definition of police independence that would produce narrower definitions of police independence than found in recent policing legislation enacted in Australia and Canada and clearer standards than found either in the common law or the Policing Protocol Order, 2011 used in England. In addition, it suggests that Police Acts should encourage transparent political direction of the police by requiring such direction to be in writing and to be made public. It will be suggested that Victoria&rsquo;s Police Service Act, 2013 and Ontario&rsquo;s new Police Act, 2018 achieve some, but not all, of these objectives.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay055/5071716?rss=1","2018-08-11 16:01:58","50","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"

"12063","Police Moonlighting and Gender Difference: Exploring Paid Detail Security For Men and Women Officers in North American Police Departments","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>Paid detail public police work is underexplored in criminal justice and criminological research. As a result, gender disparities for women police officers in paid detail policing, entailing the private employment of public police for services that often resemble stationary guarding, have not been investigated. Based on analysis of police paid detail records and interviews with police and users of paid detail across the United States and Canada, we investigate the significance of paid detail for police officer pay and differences by gender. We discuss gender proportions in police departments and compare them to gender proportions in paid detail assignments. Our analysis reveals all nine police departments selected as case studies had far more men than women officers. This dominance was also evidenced by the fact that most assignments were taken up by men in all nine departments. Moreover, albeit the differences were usually modest, in seven of nine departments, the proportion of assignments taken up by men was greater than the proportion of men in the department. After reflecting on explanations for why this disparity exists, we conclude with recommendations for policy reform, and directions for future research.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1057/s41284-018-0151-4","2018-08-13 15:17:29","39","Security Journal"

                  <p>Using a multidimensional approach to poverty measurement, this article aims to contribute to an improved understanding on the main aspects of deprivation experienced by former participants of organized crime in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, a city that became the epicenter of violence due to the &lsquo;war on drugs&rsquo; declared in 2006. A sample of 180 surveys and 20 in-depth interviews were implemented to evaluate multidimensional poverty amongst young men serving a prison sentence for a series of crimes related to organized criminal activity (aged 12 to 29) in Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua. An equal number of surveys were implemented to a group of non-offenders who had no criminal record and resided in a marginalized area of the same city. The research finds that while offenders fared worse in several non-income dimensions of poverty compared to non-offenders, qualitative evidence revealed that experiences of poverty of offenders were not homogenous, as suggested by existing studies. One of the key findings to emerge from the research is that participation in organized crime decreases income poverty; however, participation did not constitute an effective nor sustained pathway out of poverty nor did it decrease deprivation in other dimensions due to a highly skewed distribution of income in the illegal economy and the use of gains from illegal activity to fuel conspicuous consumption, findings that are similar in the established Western literature on youth gangs.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10611-018-9785-8","2018-08-13 21:15:30","30","Crime, Law and Social Change"

                  <p>This study explores international domestic workers&rsquo; response to employer abuse and exploitation following changes to Canada&rsquo;s Live-in-Caregiver Program in 2014. This research followed an interpretive policy analysis research design, using feminist, participatory, and action research methods. University-based researchers, advocates, and peer researchers collaborated to develop and implement the project&rsquo;s research and advocacy goals. Thirty-one caregivers in Toronto and Calgary participated in individual and/or focus group interviews to discuss access to permanent residence, working conditions and forms of support. Many shared examples of labor exploitation and psychological hardship due to precarious work conditions and long periods of family separation. Barriers to accessing services and fear of losing status led the majority of caregivers to rely primarily on informal networks for mutual aid and support. This paper identifies how changes in Canada&rsquo;s temporary foreign worker program for live-in-caregivers exacerbates the structural violence of migrant care work, where the risk for abuse, exploitation, and risk of losing status is normalized. Migrant caregivers accept the precarious work conditions with the promise of permanent residence and the chance to improve their lives for themselves and their children. Towards envisioning improvements in social service delivery, our research highlighted the need for social services to increase outreach and safety planning for migrant workers who are vulnerable to abuse, exploitation, and the loss of legal immigration status. Our research also supports grassroots advocacy to&nbsp;call for all migrant workers to be granted permanent resident status upon arrival to ameliorate the structural violence of migrant labor.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-9988-x","2018-08-13 21:16:31","38","Journal of Family Violence"

"12070","Stalking: An Examination of the Correlates of Subsequent Police Responses","Policing: An International Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose Few studies have explored the correlates of police responses to the crime of stalking. The purpose of this paper is to examine the correlates of nine specific police actions (no action, multiple actions, took a report, talked to perpetrator, arrested perpetrator, recommended PO or RO, recommended self-protection, referred to prosecutorâ€™s office and referred to social services) to this type of crime. This study found three of the four incident measures (victim-offender relationship, intimidation and physical injury) and three of the four victim demographic measures (age, gender and marital status) significantly predicted seven of the nine police actions.   Design/methodology/approach Data for this study came from the 2006 Stalking Victimization Supplement of the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS). The sample included stalking cases that were reported to the police and all measures were constructed using victimsâ€™ responses to survey questionnaires. Nine logistic regression models were estimated and in each model, four incident characteristic variables and four victim demographic variables were regressed on each of the nine police actions.   Findings This study found three of the four incident characteristic measures (victim-offender relationship, intimidation, and physical injury) and three of the four victim demographic variables (age, gender and marital status) were significantly related to seven of the nine specific police actions (no action, multiple actions, arrested perpetrator, recommended PO or RO, recommended self-protection, referred to prosecutorâ€™s office and referred to social services). None of the incident characteristic and victim demographic measures were related to two of the nine specific police actions (took a report and talked to perpetrator).   Research limitations/implications This study possesses the same shortcomings associated with the NCVS. The current study involves cross-sectional, official data that are over 10 years old. The measures employed in the current study are victimsâ€™ perceptions of how the officers acted. The study does not include information regarding how many times the victim contacted the police or the nature of the stalking episode. The study excludes other variables (suspectâ€™s demeanor, the presence of witnesses) that may be relevant in examining subsequent police responses to stalking.   Practical implications Frontline offices should be required to undertake stalking training. Further, stalking training needs to be conducted independently from domestic violence training. Mandatory stalking training for law enforcement officers will lead to a greater comprehension of existing stalking statute for the officers as well as help increase the number of offenders being identified and charged with this crime by the officers.   Social implications Police inaction to reported stalking not only dissuade victims from reporting future victimizations, it will also result in stalking being an under-reported crime. Police inaction could potentially compromise victim safety and/or offender accountability. Police inaction also undermines the legitimacy of law enforcement and attenuates the relationship between citizens and police agencies.   Originality/value To date, only one study has examined the correlates of subsequent police responses to the crime of stalking. However, this study employed broad measures of police actions (formal and informal). The current study involves specific police actions (e.g. taking a report, referring the victim to social service agencies). Contrary to the prior study that found none of the incident and victim characteristics was related to two broad measures of subsequent police responses, this study found several incident and victim measures significantly predicted seven specific police actions.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-12-2017-0157?af=R","2018-08-14 10:17:17","98","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

This can improve both time spent traveling to calls, as well as equalize call load between patrol areas.   Design/methodology/approach The paper provides an introduction to the use of integer linear programs to create optimal patrol areas, as many analysts and researchers in the authorâ€™s field will not be familiar with such models. The analysis then introduces a set of linear constraints to the p-median problem that are applicable to police agencies, such as constraining call loads to be equal and making patrol areas geographically contiguous.   Findings The analysis illustrates the technique on simplified simulated examples. The analysis then demonstrates the utility of the technique by showing how patrol areas in Carrollton, TX can be made both more efficient and equalize the call loads given the same number of patrol beats as currently in place.   Originality/value Unlike prior applications of creating patrol areas, this paper introduces linear constraints into the p-median problem, making it much easier to solve than programs that have non-linear or multiple objective functions. Supplementary code using open source software is also provided, allowing other analysts or researchers to apply the model to their own data.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-02-2018-0027?af=R","2018-08-14 10:17:17","97","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

                  <p>The current study addresses the lack of research exploring the social and emotional impact of anti-immigrant policy on Latino communities, and the intersection of anti-immigrant climates with other family stressors, like domestic violence (DV). In this paper we describe a qualitative study led by the participatory action research group La Voz Juvenile de Caminar Latino. Youth researchers conducted semi-structured interviews with Latino men, women, and youth participating in a domestic violence program. Using an inductive approach to thematic analysis, researchers identified themes that reflect how Latino families with histories of DV experience an increasingly anti-immigrant climate. All participants in this study described emotional stress, fear, and restrictions in their day-to-day life attributed to the anti-immigrant sociopolitical climate, and adults also spoke to work-related stress and economic insecurity. Both adults and children described harassment by strangers, coworkers, and/or peers. With regard to DV, women tended to describe immigration stress as exasperating family conflict, while men viewed these external stressors as discouraging DV. Distrust of police and other formal supports was a key theme underlying adult and youth perceptions of help-seeking for DV. The findings of this study suggest that anti-immigrant sentiment and policy creates undue stress for Latino families and barriers to formal help-seeking for DV. The participatory research process provided a corrective experience for youth witnesses of DV and prioritizes the voices of those most affected by immigration policies and violence.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-9990-3","2018-08-16 11:31:16","23","Journal of Family Violence"

There is even less literature on automobile-related incidents and deaths in relation to rural policing. Based on 14 focus groups with police officers (<span>n</span> = 49) across a primarily rural Canadian province, we probe the various driving-related risks faced by these officers. Drawing from the literature on automobility, we examine the various aspects of driving that place officers at risk of fatality. We highlight the driving-related occupational risks specific to rural policing and how such risks inhibit their ability to conduct their jobs safely and effectively. We conclude with policy implications and avenues for future research.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay057/5075311?rss=1","2018-08-16 17:02:01","76","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"

                  <p>The present study explored the perceptions of workers who provide intimate partner violence (IPV) services regarding child welfare workers&rsquo; IPV assessment and referral processes. Data from four focus groups was interrogated to find common themes. A total of 27 individuals participated in the focus groups, working in the community, shelters, and prisons/jails. Participants primarily expressed concerns regarding child welfare workers&rsquo; practices. IPV providers perceived child welfare workers as incompetent in performing IPV assessments and making referrals. IPV workers also perceived that some child welfare workers engaged in dismissive, manipulative, or coercive behaviors when working with IPV victims. While the present findings are not generalizable, they speak to the tension frequently noted between victim services and child welfare. Child welfare agencies should consider ongoing, trauma-informed training for IPV assessment to help increase worker self-efficacy in performing these tasks. Local, interdisciplinary trainings including both IPV and child welfare providers may be particularly useful to promote better understanding of each provider&rsquo;s role in cases with co-occurring IPV and child maltreatment concerns, which may help to reduce tensions between the intersecting service systems.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-9991-2","2018-08-17 23:16:38","37","Journal of Family Violence"

                  <p>Political corruption is a complicated issue, with pundits, scholars, and armchair theorists speculating on what makes politics so seemingly corrupt. The US agency tasked with investigating and correcting this corruption is the Department of Justice&rsquo;s (DOJ) Public Integrity Section (PIN). However, to date, there is no analysis of how corruption is interpreted and framed by this important government agency. Using a constructionist framework, a content analysis of thirty-five years of annual PIN reports to Congress is undertaken, demonstrating: 1) the PIN never explicitly defines what corruption is; 2) the PIN pays particular attention to the most dramatic cases of corruption (as opposed to the more mundane, typical cases) and emphasizes private businesses and individual malfeasance as exemplars of corruption. Finally, 3) the PIN has recently stopped briefly detailing each case they worked on in a year, and instead only present major highlights. In conclusion, the PIN frames corruption in a way that limits the ability for meaningful social change to occur at an institutional level.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10611-018-9788-5","2018-08-18 09:15:33","25","Crime, Law and Social Change"

                  <p>The FATF requires each country to undertake a national risk assessment (NRA) to show the government&rsquo;s knowledge of money laundering risks. There is little guidance as to how these NRAs are to be conducted, and those that have been published show great variation in terms of data used, analytical methods, and the depth of policy analysis. After expounding some of the concepts basic to any risk analysis, we analyze two of the more detailed published NRAs, from Italy and Switzerland. The Italian NRA, focused on domestic criminal threats, relies almost exclusively on expert opinion. Its most distinctive product is an analysis of the high-threat sectors and the need for specific kinds of policy interventions. The Swiss NRA, focused primarily on threats from other countries, presents far more quantitative data, almost exclusively from suspicious activity reports, to supplement expert opinion. Though both NRAs provide useful insights about money laundering risks, neither is conceptually clear; in particular, neither reflects contemporary practice in the use of expert opinion. Our critique is aimed at helping strengthen the next round of NRAs, and identifies lessons learned for all countries. Our recommendations include the use of risk assessment standards from other fields, the addition of a measure of uncertainty, and a more critical assessment by FATF in its NRA evaluations.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10610-018-9395-0","2018-08-20 14:15:50","30","European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research"

                  <p>Addressing sexual and relationship violence (SRV) on campuses requires coordinated engagement from all members of the campus-community; however, many campuses do not yet have the infrastructure or institutional commitment to build an all-campus action plan. In such cases, campuses lack the metaphorical table around which collaboration happens.&nbsp;This paper presents tensions and lessons learned so far from a faculty-staff-student partnership to build a movement toward university-wide collaborative practice. Through iterative, collaborative reflection on our context, practice, and intermediate outcomes, we identified recommendations for improving praxis in campus-based, intersectional anti-SRV organizing. Our analysis explores how our individual positionalities both open up and limit our potential to move this work forward. We share our guiding values and frameworks, including intersectional feminist attention to power and oppression; centering survivors and students; strategic collaboration within systems; and integrating self-care and other supportive practices for building a sustainable movement. Our emergent strategy, illustrated through ten lessons/tensions and four case examples, focuses on finding close collaborators with shared SRV analysis; making the best use of resources and spaces we control; identifying meaningful &ldquo;small wins;&rdquo; and pursuing opportunities to connect to others through positive collaborations. Efforts to intentionally raise awareness and grow strategic institutional connections build momentum toward institutionally-supported campus-wide evaluation and reimagining of prevention and survivor-support efforts. While feminist collaborative social change is challenging, we celebrate and learn from our &ldquo;two steps forward&rdquo; to sustain us through the inevitable steps back. We write to stir a conversation where we help each other interpret and learn across our varied contexts.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-9986-z","2018-08-20 19:31:14","23","Journal of Family Violence"

                  <p>Despite the known implications of texting while driving for reducing driver alertness and increasing traffic accidents, investigating the potential causes of the behavior is something that criminologists have only recently started to investigate. The current study builds on this small body of research by assessing whether low self-control is associated with the frequency of texting while driving and, further, whether this association is moderated by perceptions of the texting habits of other drivers and best friends. Results based on data collected from a sample of 469 young adults indicate that low self-control is positively associated with the frequency of texting while driving. In addition, this association is amplified by an individual&rsquo;s perceptions of the proportion of other drivers who engage in texting while driving, but not by the texting and driving habits of best friends.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12103-018-9448-4","2018-08-21 04:15:14","52","American Journal of Criminal Justice"

                  <p>General theories of crime and delinquency are tested in part by their ability to explain the empirical findings of cross-national research. Systematic research using comparable survey methods provides a rich body of data from many countries and settings that inform such tests. There are several aspects of the general theory proposed by Gottfredson and Hirschi (<span>1990</span>) that facilitate the idea of global criminology which, coupled with this growing research literature, support the idea of general theories of crime. These include use of a &ldquo;crime-free&rdquo; definition for dependent variables, disciplinary-free assumptions about human nature, appreciating the distinction between propensities and events in crime theory, incorporating the burgeoning empirical literature from many disciplines stressing the importance of childhood environments and self-control, and focusing on recent successful prevention efforts. A set of research needs stimulated by modern global criminology are also proposed.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11417-018-9275-z","2018-08-21 06:15:18","36","Asian Journal of Criminology"

Design/methodology/approach This study employs a national, stratified, representative survey of US law enforcement agencies with 100 or more officers.   Findings LPR technology is currently used by at least two-thirds of larger police agencies, which represents a more than threefold increase in LPR acquisition in the last 10 years. The number of LPRs per agency, while small (about eight on average), has also more than doubled. Federal and state funding, advocacy by law enforcement leaders, and the intuitive appeal of LPRs have likely contributed to this rapid adoption. While LPRs are still primarily used to detect and recover stolen automobiles in patrol, their use has expanded into other types of investigative and security functions. Despite the increased use and numbers of LPRs in policing, their use is highly discretionary and infrequently tracked.   Practical implications LPRs continue to be widely used in law enforcement, despite a lack of strong research evidence for their crime prevention benefits. Further studies are needed on the most effective ways for agencies to utilize small numbers of LPRs and the potential return on investment for acquiring larger numbers of the devices.   Originality/value This study tracks the history of LPR diffusion and use and goes beyond prior law enforcement surveys by examining specific uses of LPRs and the extent to which agencies track their uses and outcomes.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-04-2018-0054?af=R","2018-08-21 08:16:54","96","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

                  <p>The Engaging Men project aimed to identify facilitators, societal approaches to and support for domestic violence, and barriers to men&rsquo;s participation in domestic violence research, assessing the importance of each factor. Participatory concept mapping was used with a convenience sample of men (<em>n</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;142) in person and online across Australia, Canada and the United States of America. Engaging Men identified 43 facilitators, societal approaches to and support for domestic violence, and/or barriers to men&rsquo;s participation in domestic violence research. The strongest facilitators related to external connections, such as concern for women around them. Men also recognized societal approaches to and support for domestic violence and the strongest barriers centered on internal feelings, including fear, shame and guilt about being linked to domestic violence. This study suggests that providing a safe environment for men to express genuine thoughts, feeling and views about domestic violence is vital, yet rarely available in domestic violence research. Therefore, research opportunities need to be more effectively designed and incentivized to address challenging issues identified by men, such as fear, shame and guilt and offer meaningful opportunities to demonstrate positive change.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-9985-0","2018-08-22 02:31:22","80","Journal of Family Violence"

"12146","Police Education in the USA","<span><div>Abstract</div>Higher education for police has a 100-year history in the USA. Initially, it incorporated both &lsquo;education&rsquo; and much of what is now considered &lsquo;training&rsquo;, out of necessity because police occupational training had yet to be widely implemented. Since the 1960s, though, separate police training institutions and systems have been established throughout the country. In conjunction with this bifurcation of education and training, the dominant higher education model for police became &lsquo;criminal justice&rsquo;. Over the last 40 years, criminal justice has become a very popular field of study in American colleges and universities, curricula have broadened to include a wide variety of crime and justice topics, and faculty academic credentials have risen to meet and exceed higher education standards. In the process, however, policing has become a smaller and smaller part of the criminal justice educational enterprise. Today, what passes for police education in the USA has very little police in it.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay064/5077385?rss=1","2018-08-22 08:01:55","177","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"

                  <p>This study focuses on Italian corruption among mayors, since they are key players in the Italian institutions. Political decentralization has brought local government closer to the citizens while allowing a more direct expression of democracy on the part of mayors. In this study, we analyse the probability of mayors committing crime with i) external actors, i.e., entrepreneurs, professionals or other politicians, ii) mafia-type organizations or iii) actors within the municipality, such as council members, cabinet members and council employees. As the main data source, the study relies on the judgments of the Italian Court of Cassation. The results show that i) mayors represent an important gateway for external groups for awarding public contracts and misappropriating public funds, and ii) mayors linked to mafia-type groups are usually merely the executors of the criminal activity, whereas the <em>mafiosi</em> are the planners.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12117-018-9349-4","2018-08-23 10:17:25","35","Trends in Organized Crime"

                  <p>This study presents evidence on the cross-cultural generalizability of differential association/social learning theory by testing whether the causal processes of learning attitudes toward deviance, posited by the theory, are equally applicable, and the causal links, specified by the theory, are equally strong in two diverse cultures&mdash;the USA and Japan. Drawing on the literature concerning cultural variability in individualism-collectivism, we predicted that the effects of peer reactions to deviance and peer deviance on a person&rsquo;s attitudes toward deviance should be stronger in Japan than in the USA, and that the mediating effect of a person&rsquo;s attitudes on the relationship of peer reactions and peer deviance to a person&rsquo;s deviance should be weaker among Japanese than among Americans. Analyses of comparable survey data from college students in the USA (<em>N</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;625) and Japan (<em>N</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;591) provide generally supportive, but somewhat mixed, evidence regarding our predictions. In both countries, peer reactions to deviance predicted student attitudes toward deviance more strongly than did peer deviance. Peer deviance strongly predicted student deviance, while peer reactions to deviance predicted less strongly, and the effects were mediated by student attitudes in both countries. Contrary to the hypotheses, peer reactions and peer deviance did not predict student attitudes more strongly in Japan than in the USA. Also, peer deviance predicted student deviance more strongly in the USA than in Japan. In agreement with the expectations, the relation between student attitudes and student deviance was stronger in the USA than in Japan.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11417-018-9276-y","2018-08-23 10:30:19","41","Asian Journal of Criminology"

                  <span>
                    <h3>Objectives</h3>
                    <p>The advent of mass incarceration has reinvigorated calls for a deeper understanding of how the &ldquo;quality of relationships&rdquo; is shaped by imprisonment (Travis J, Western B, Redburn S (eds), The growth of incarceration in the United States: exploring causes and consequences, National Academies Press, Washington DC, <span>2014</span>). We address this issue by describing how imprisonment relates to four dimensions of tie strength in a sample of South Bronx residents.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>We draw on a series of survey-based multilevel models to examine how tie strength relates to characteristics of respondents and their self-reported contacts (N<sub>1</sub>&thinsp;=&thinsp;585 ties, N<sub>2</sub>&thinsp;=&thinsp;97 egos) regarding (a) frequency, (b) duration, (c) multiplexity, and (d) reciprocity.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>Ties of formerly-incarcerated persons are of shorter duration and exhibit less overlap relative to other respondents. However, markers of general association across the sample to currently/formerly incarcerated persons correlate with alter-ego ties that are more frequent, long-lasting, and multi-dimensional.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>There is some support for the notion that direct exposure to incarceration is linked to a weakening of ties akin to a &ldquo;knifing-off&rdquo; process (Maruna and Roy, J Contemp Crim Justice 23(1):104&ndash;124, <span>2007</span>). Indirect exposure to incarceration may follow an inverse pattern, strengthening the ties among those &ldquo;left behind&rdquo;.</p>

                  <span>
                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>This study seeks to determine the extent to which Tittle&rsquo;s control balance (CB) theory (CBT: 1995) accurately predicts different types of deviance within a corporate setting (in this case, a financial services corporation). CB&nbsp;theory contends that deviance is the result of a control imbalance between the amount of control a person exerts and the amount to which they are subject. Control deficits result in repressive deviance (including most types of predatory crime). Control surpluses result in autonomous deviance (including many types of white collar offending).</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Method</h3>
                    <p>We exploit a unique dataset consisting of the internal investigations of fraud conducted by a large United States-based financial services company to explore these concepts in the corporate sales environment.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>Consistent with the theory, we find that a control surplus predicts certain autonomous deviance while a control deficit explained some repressive forms of criminality. Results also indicate that a control imbalance is incremental in nature and not simply a balanced/non-balanced condition. Further discussion revolves around implications, limitations, and future research.</p>

                  <p>During an era when campuses nationwide are increasingly in the spotlight for a range of sexual assault infractions, Rothman proposes four groundbreaking thought experiments that challenge the status quo in campus-based prevention programming and call for us to do better. Namely, Rothman&rsquo;s thought experiments&mdash;which suggest that campuses 1) invest in fighting structural oppression at the societal level, 2) direct their social norming work at the macro level, 3) educate preventionists in consent and pleasure related to kink, anal sex and group sex, and 4) enact education and counseling for sexual violence perpetrators&mdash;provide us with fresh opportunities to examine our willingness and capacity to change and to become even more&nbsp;impactful leaders in practices to reduce sexual violence. In the present editorial, I argue that for Rothman&rsquo;s experiments (which are focused fundamentally on changing underlying power structures at the intersection of gender, race, sexuality, ability status and socioeconomic status) to be optimally effective, campuses must first engage intensively and systematically in anti-bias curricula to prepare us to be effective fighters for civil rights and human rights. Accordingly, we must be willing to acknowledge that biases exist in all of us, that biases operate in across environments to both privilege and disadvantage at the intersection of gender, race, sexuality, ability status and socioeconomic status, and that we must replace our biases with equity-focused actions for greater equity for all. I applaud Rothman in her outside-the-box thought experiments, join her in challenging us to do things differently on our nation&rsquo;s campuses, and hope we have the courage to be leaders in anti-bias, civil rights and human rights practices to more impactfully&nbsp;reduce sexual violence against women and non-majority groups.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-9994-z","2018-08-27 04:16:36","34","Journal of Family Violence"

                  <p>Law enforcement&rsquo;s examination of vehicle crashes is often nested in the Data-Driven Approaches to Crime and Traffic Safety (DDACTS) framework which highlights the importance of hot spot analysis. To assist law enforcement efforts, this study explores how two additional spatial techniques, namely risk terrain modeling (RTM) and conjunctive analysis of case configurations (CACC), could be incorporated within the DDACTS framework. RTM was utilized to identify how the built, physical environment contributed to the risk of traffic incidents. RTM identified 6 risk factors related to the occurrence of vehicle crashes, and high-risk places were compared to hot spots on predictive accuracy. CACC was used to explore configurations likely to result in traffic incidents for the priority places. Our findings support the Theory of Risky Places and fit within a vulnerability-exposure framework, providing law enforcement with guidance for identifying places where vehicle crashes are likely to occur in the future. In addition to providing insight for law enforcement, we discuss how law enforcement can develop working partnerships with stakeholders capable of preventing and/or reducing traffic incidents, which is in line with the general DDACTS framework.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12103-018-9449-3","2018-08-27 12:30:17","112","American Journal of Criminal Justice"

                  <p>This paper reviews three decades of data associated with a large-scale open street CCTV program introduced in the City of Ipswich, in the state of Queensland, Australia, in 1994. In 2018, there were over 300 cameras in operation with live monitoring and relays to police and security officers on the beat. Over the years a number of dramatic claims have been made about the impact of the program, including an overall reduction in crime of 80% and high rates of crimes being solved. However, the Ipswich City Council, which operates the program, was unable to provide data to support these claims. In response, the researchers accessed all available police data for the area and comparable areas. No evidence could be found for any specific benefits from the program. The findings that add to those from the literature are that CCTV programs often lack a scientifically grounded implementation and evaluation process, and are vulnerable to misuse for political purposes. The paper concludes by reiterating best-practice standards in crime prevention programs, including accountability and transparency, and the use of standard evaluation protocols.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1057/s41284-018-0152-3","2018-08-27 15:32:01","69","Security Journal"

                  <p>Several studies have examined predictors surrounding fear of crime. Fear of crime has generally been conceptualized as an affective emotional state regarding concern over victimization or as a cognitive state of perceived risk of victimization. While there are many potential predictors of fear of crime, there are two main groups of predictors: individual demographics and neighborhood physical and social disorder. Previous research has predominantly focused on large, urban cities. Less research has been published surrounding smaller cities and towns. As such, the current study involved a mailed household survey of a small city of around 80,000 residents in Pennsylvania. The study examined demographic predictors in line with the vulnerability model and neighborhood contextual predictors of residents&rsquo; fear of crime associated with the incivilities model. While the main analyses employed a more affective measure of fear of crime, a supplementary analysis using a measure of perceived neighborhood crime problems was examined as well. Findings revealed that in line with previous research, females and minorities were more likely to be fearful of crime. However, less favorable views of local police, more physical disorder, and more social disorder were also related to greater fear of crime and accounted for a much larger proportion of the variance explaining fear of crime. Supplementary findings strongly supported the importance of neighborhood contextual factors in predicting perceptions of crime problems, including the views of police, physical, and social disorder. However, no demographic factors predicted perceived neighborhood crime problems. Implications and limitations of the study findings are discussed.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12103-018-9450-x","2018-08-28 21:15:15","126","American Journal of Criminal Justice"

The Special Constabulary has represented an under-researched aspect of policing, with motivations to join, morale, factors relating to length of service and reasons for leaving being poorly understood. This article draws upon data from a national survey of Special Constables undertaken across all police forces in England and Wales. The analysis illustrates differences in motivations, dependent on age, and length of service, with younger Special Constables viewing the role as a pathway to future paid employment as a Regular police officer. The results contradict perspectives that attribute attrition from the Special Constabulary primarily to changes in personal circumstances for Specials, demonstrating how such changes are less important than satisfaction with the experience of being a Special Constable. The article concludes by identifying the significance of the findings for future policy and practice in respect of the Special Constabulary.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay058/5086096?rss=1","2018-08-29 09:01:59","217","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"

                  <p>Latina girls are disproportionately represented in the US juvenile justice system (Freiburger and Burke <span>2011</span>). Almost all girls involved with juvenile justice report some form of emotional, physical or sexual abuse prior to interactions with the juvenile justice system; with over 60% of girls reporting trauma before the age of 5 (Dierkhising et al. <span>2013</span>). For Latina girls, juvenile detention is associated with early death as Latina girls who have been detained are nine times more likely to die by the age of 29 than the general non-detained population (Teplin et al. <span>2014</span>). The stark reality faced by system-involved Latinas calls for innovative solutions.</p>
                  <p>In 2015, the National Compadres Network (NCN), with over 30 years of work embedded in the Chicano/Latino and Indigenous communities in California, developed a project to respond to the disparities in the juvenile justice system faced by Latina girls. Through this project, the NCN used a healing-informed curriculum (Xinachtli) and Youth Participatory Action Research (YPAR) to engage Latina system-involved girls as equal partners to inform detention alternatives and reform.</p>
                  <p>This paper will describe these efforts, provide insights from the YPAR facilitators and youth researchers, and provide recommendations for other community-based facilitators who are considering utilizing YPAR through a healing-informed approach within their own work with Latina girls.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-9996-x","2018-08-30 18:16:33","49","Journal of Family Violence"
"12199","Estimating the Prevalence of Intimate Partner Violence in Mainland China â€“ Insights and Challenges","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>Intimate partner violence (IPV) has been the subject of inquiry by scholars and governments, the latter being required by International Conventions and explicitly supported in National Plans in select jurisdictions to undertake this type of research. While establishing the prevalence of IPV has been a priority globally for some time now, there has been relatively little focus on estimating the prevalence of IPV in Mainland China until recently. This article presents the findings of a scoping review of literature examining the prevalence of IPV in China. The scoping process located only 14 peer-reviewed articles written in English and 12 in Chinese-language journals published between 1997 and 2016 meeting the inclusion criteria set for the review. The results of the scoping review indicate that in China, the lifetime prevalence of victimization of IPV reported in the general population is within a range of 17.4 to 24.5% for psychological violence, 2.5 to 5.5% for physical violence, and 0.3 to 1.7% for sexual violence using national survey data. The prevalence of IPV in China can also be estimated from research data sets focusing on specific population groups. However, the methodologies used in such studies vary considerably making comparison of results difficult. As well as providing insight into the prevalence of IPV in China, this article identifies the challenges in estimating prevalence and presents contextual factors particular to China. Directions for future research to develop a culturally specific definition of IPV and identify IPV in non-married couples are also suggested.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-9989-9","2018-08-31 00:16:18","28","Journal of Family Violence"

                  <p>This article highlights the ways in which power is conceptualized, activated, and institutionalized in American culture. Drawing from research and the author&rsquo;s experience within mainstream and culturally-specific organizations in the violence against women field, this article exposes the subtle, yet pervasive mechanisms that lead to the marginalization of culturally specific communities and smaller, typically culturally specific, community-based organizations. By design and unconsciously, researchers, mainstream organization, and leaders often perpetuate a system designed to localize research, evaluation, services and resources for white people, organizations and institutions. This occurs for example, when researchers center and elevate a &ldquo;gold-standard&rdquo; of evidence-based practices, research, and evaluation that share no frame of reference to those being &ldquo;studied&rdquo; and most effected. It also happens when organizations marginalize culturally specific community members and organizations by seeking their participation at the final stages rather than at the conception of projects. The author provides concrete recommendations that researchers, providers, and leaders can adopt to counteract institutional oppression and help move culturally-specific communities and organizations from the margins to the center.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-9984-1","2018-08-31 19:37:05","37","Journal of Family Violence"

                  <p>Using an assisted desistance framework, this paper explores the lived experiences of 11 volunteers on the Community Based Health and First Aid programme, which operates in 14 prisons across Ireland and aims to enhance community health, hygiene awareness and first aid knowledge among prisoners through peer-to-peer education. The findings suggest that participation fostered a sense of agency among volunteers and facilitated the development of a new non-criminal self, centred on the &lsquo;wounded healer&rsquo; identity. Additionally, participation appeared to deepen volunteers&rsquo; pro-social bonds with other prisoners, staff and families. The contribution of these findings to knowledge about desistance and desistance-focused practice is considered.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10610-018-9396-z","2018-08-31 21:21:19","41","European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research"

                  <p>Grassroots community efforts intuitively understand the physics of relationships&mdash;that you cannot interact with something or someone, even if that interaction is simply observation, without having an impact. Research shapes the way our lives are imagined. There&rsquo;s no way around it. But developing relationships with researchers or others who can help document and disseminate &lsquo;by and for&rsquo; information can be challenging for grassroots and community led initiatives. When institutions seek to include marginalized community priorities into pre-existing frameworks or study initiatives, or when researchers come from the outside, extract information from our community organizations and grassroots efforts, and then leave to analyze and make meaning of it elsewhere, the result is never accurate and our own community led trajectories of learning are disrupted and undermined. From significant changes to how research collaborations are conceived and funded, to simple fixes to approaches used in the field, researchers can be better partners to community led efforts to document and understand our own lives.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-9992-1","2018-09-01 07:37:18","66","Journal of Family Violence"

                  <p>Private-to-private corruption has no direct victim and is therefore difficult to combat. Yet it undermines market competition, impedes growth, and sets development at risk. Therefore, knowledge about the reasons for committing crimes is necessary for changing corrupt practices within private sector. This article explores business managers&rsquo; perceptions of the extent of bribing within their lines of business and possible explanations for these perceptions. We analyze a survey of 1000 managers of private companies in Denmark and Estonia using structural equation models. Comparing two behavioral causes for bribes, a rational choice theory and a cognitivist theory of action, which adds moral judgment to instrumental rationality, we find that managers find corruption less common when they see it as a breach of their own moral judgment. Costs of bribing do not matter and benefits from bribing play a marginal role in the perceived extent of bribing. Context is also important: managers in Denmark and outside capital cities in both countries deem bribing less common and this is not because they are personally less tolerant of bribing. The implication of this study is that fostering condemnatory attitudes toward private-to-private corruption should be a standard act in combating this form of corporate crime.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10611-018-9790-y","2018-09-03 12:15:22","58","Crime, Law and Social Change"

                  <p>Over the past three decades, the public outcry over the incidence of police corruption in Nigeria has increased despite concerted efforts to reform the police and improve their service delivery. Of recent, the public resentment of police involvement in street corruption, abuse of crime suspects, and extra-judicial killings has caught the attention of the international community and led to human rights groups&rsquo; agitation for the overhauling of the police particularly the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS). This study was conducted to investigate the experience of police corruption, specifically extortion and victimization, among commercial drivers in Lagos metropolis. The study sought to know whether the nature of service rendered by the commercial drivers and their level of education are associated with police extortion and victimization. It also investigated other possible predictors of exposure to police extortion. The study was carried out among taxi drivers, commercial bus drivers, motorcyclists, and tricyclists in Ikeja, Mushin, and Somolu local government areas of the state. The study adopted cross-sectional survey design and mixed method of data collection. Multi-stage sampling and convenience sampling techniques were adopted. A sample size of 300 was chosen. Structured questionnaire, observation, and in-depth interview guide were used to gather data from participants. It was found that the nature of service rendered by the commercial drivers were associated with both experience of victimization (<em>&chi;</em><sup>2</sup> 13.229; <em>p</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.004) and police extortion (<em>&chi;</em><sup>2</sup>&thinsp;=&thinsp;9.630; <em>p</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.022), while the level of education was not significant. Ethnicity and encounter with police were other significant predictors of exposure to police extortion.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9289-6","2018-09-03 15:31:41","37","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"

                    <h3>Objectives</h3>
                    <p>To examine whether the introduction of an acoustic gunshot detection system (AGDS) allied to CCTV cameras increased the frequency of confirmed incidents of shots fired by bringing to notice gunfire events in public places that were not reported by the public.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>In a partially block-randomized experimental design, 17 acoustic sensors were co-located with CCTV cameras in a balanced design that matched the sensor camera sites with equivalent control locations. Gunshot-related incidents within 900&nbsp;ft of both intervention and control sites for 8&nbsp;months pre- and post-intervention were examined with multilevel negative binomial regression models.</p>

                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>After implementation of the AGDS, gunshot incidents increased by 259%; however, there was no significant increase in the number of confirmed shootings.</p>

                    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>The AGDS did not significantly affect the number of confirmed shootings, but it did increase the workload of police attending incidents for which no evidence of a shooting was found. While awaiting technological improvements and considering the operational goals, police departments may wish to reconsider the current operational plan and objective of an AGDS.</p>

                  <p>The purpose of this special issue is to explore how researchers, evaluators, and practitioners use community-based, participatory research (CBPR) approaches to prevent gender-based violence, support survivors, and transform communities and systems. In this introduction, the editors define gender-based violence (GBV) and briefly discuss how systemic inequities exacerbate the prevalence of GBV. The authors featured in this special issue aim to dismantle these inequities by engaging in research approaches that center those who are most impacted by the social issue, ensure that community members guide the research process, build community capacity, and aim to transform oppressive conditions. The issue includes six empirical studies across the United States that cover the process and outcomes of conducting transformative CBPR. It also contains six commentaries from GBV adult practitioners and young people who provide pertinent insights on their experiences working with academic researchers and/or engaging in participatory research. The articles in this special issue cover the major themes of defining community, working in inequitable conditions, and transforming individuals and communities.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-9998-8","2018-09-05 13:31:10","34","Journal of Family Violence"

Design/methodology/approach Measures of sexual violence risk, treatment change and outcome variables were coded retrospectively on a sample of 86 high Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R) scoring sexual offenders. Psychopathy subtypes were identified through cluster analysis of PCL-R facet scores.   Findings Two subtypes were identified labeled classic and aggressive. They were comparable in their level of risk and need and did not differ in rates of treatment completion or change. The aggressive subtype had higher rates of violent and general recidivism and higher frequencies of major mental disorder and cognitive disability. Results of Cox regression survival analysis demonstrated that treatment-related changes in risk were associated with reductions in violent recidivism for the aggressive, but not classic, psychopathy variant.   Practical implications Psychopathy is a heterogeneous syndrome. Moreover, psychopathic offenders can demonstrate risk relevant treatment changes. PCL-R facet profiles have important responsivity implications. However, not all psychopathic offenders fare poorly in treatment.   Originality/value This is one of very few studies to examine treatment response and links to outcome among psychopathic offenders, particularly as this relates to subtype.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JCRPP-11-2017-0035?af=R","2018-09-06 15:16:03","42","Journal of Criminological Research, Policy and Practice"

                  <p>Grounded in an ontological, theoretical and methodological position that views children&rsquo;s views and experiences of domestic violence as critical to our understanding of those experiences, this letter to the editor reflects on Kimball&rsquo;s (<em>Journal of Family Violence</em>, <em>31</em>, 625&ndash;637, <span>2016</span>) review of research since 1999 when Edleson&rsquo;s influential article on children exposed to domestic violence was published (<em>Journal of Interpersonal violence,</em> 14(8), 839&ndash;870). Welcoming Kimball&rsquo;s call for research that can &lsquo;capture the full effects of children&rsquo;s exposure&rsquo;, we nonetheless challenge Kimball&rsquo;s criticism of the paucity of research literature directly capturing children&rsquo;s voices. Rather, we argue in this letter that Kimball&rsquo;s (<em>Journal of Family Violence</em>, <em>31</em>, 625&ndash;637, <span>2016</span>) methodology excluded those published qualitative studies which have engaged directly with children and sought to understand their lived experience of domestic violence. We conclude by highlighting our alignment with Kimball&rsquo;s assertion for the need to capture the voice and experience of children, but argue that this knowledge already exists. We also argue that some questions can only be answered by children and adolescents themselves.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-9997-9","2018-09-07 10:31:28","74","Journal of Family Violence"
"12230","Who Needs Critical Friends? Independent Advisory Groups in the Age of the Police and Crime Commissioner","<span><div>Abstract</div>In the early 2000s, many police forces in England and Wales set up independent advisory groups (IAGs) following an inquiry into the flawed investigation of the murder of a black teenager, Stephen Lawrence, by London's Metropolitan Police. Members of IAGs were to act as critical friends of the police providing independent advice on policies, procedures and practices, thus ensuring that no section of their local community was disadvantaged through a lack of understanding, ignorance or mistaken beliefs. Based on a case study of an IAG in an English police force, this article reviews the operation of IAGs following the radical changes made to police governance by the introduction of directly elected police and crime commissioners (PCCs). Its main argument is that more thought needs to be given to the role of IAGs in this new landscape and urgent steps taken to clarify their relationships with police forces and PCCs.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay068/5092465?rss=1","2018-09-07 16:02:06","100","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"

Design/methodology/approach In light of the limited amount of research available on handling deaf suspects, a two-part sampling approach was used. Using critical case sampling, the author surveyed law enforcement via open-ended surveys designed to solicit information about their involvement with deaf suspects and any related questions and concerns. Guided by the Wave 1 data, Wave 2 surveys were administered to law enforcement nationwide (using expert sampling).   Findings An analysis of the two waves of data collected was used to assemble the list of current practices.   Originality/value This study combines previous research on deaf suspects, which has been published largely through the framework of deaf studies, with the insight of practitioners to identify a list of current practices used by US law enforcement when handling deaf suspects.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-02-2018-0026?af=R","2018-09-08 08:16:58","67","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"
"12234","Education Or Enforcement? Enrolling Universities in the Surveillance and Policing of Migration","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>This article examines the enlistment of educational providers in the surveillance and policing of non-citizen students. Employing the USA, UK, and Australia as cases, it situates efforts that render universities responsible for managing migrant &ldquo;illegality&rdquo; in broader trends concerning legal control and security governance. In particular, it analyzes the development of electronic surveillance and information-sharing systems that mobilize the knowledge, energies, and access of educational providers for the purposes of identification, tracking, and reporting. University personnel&rsquo;s conscription as de facto border guards accentuates the pluralization of migration policing, highlighting how techniques of governance and surveillance are effectuated through quotidian actors and sites positioned beyond the sovereign state. By drawing universities into the orbit of territorial gatekeeping and interior enforcement, emergent policies are producing numerous tensions, whether in relation to their officially stated objectives or transformations in higher education&rsquo;s character, ethos, and mission and their implications for non-citizens&rsquo; legal and social identities. Alongside enhancing understandings of migration control, this paper advances conversations regarding the increasingly networked, pre-emptive, and ubiquitous qualities of social ordering and control.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10611-018-9792-9","2018-09-08 21:16:10","40","Crime, Law and Social Change"
"12235","Civil Protection Orders and Their Courtroom Context: the Impact of Gatekeepers on Legal Decisions","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>Using observational data obtained from a sample of 303 protection order hearings in a large Southwestern city, the current study explores the impact of formal (i.e., presiding Hearing Master, legal counsel, courtroom-employed translator) and informal actors (i.e., victim advocate, family members, friends) on civil protection order (CPO) decisions. Several multivariate analyses were conducted to assess the net and context-specific effects of these legal and informal actors on the likelihood of receiving an order of protection and its length of time. When examining the effectiveness of courtroom actors in assisting domestic violence (DV)/ intimate partner violence (IPV) victims with their CPO cases, this study finds that whether or not a victim successfully obtains a protection order, and for how long, depends on a range of case attributes as well as who is actually present in the courtroom with the victim. As these findings suggest, gatekeepers matter depending on a range of case attributes. States should allocate additional resources and funding to non-profit agencies to continue to promote affordable/free legal services through legal aid and other similar legal entities as well as offer continued support for victim advocacy and self-help centers.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-9999-7","2018-09-09 01:16:35","31","Journal of Family Violence"

The travel industry and law enforcement have been attempting to address travel fraud for some time. Airline tickets can be obtained using various cybercrime methods. They are traded and advertised on online blackmarkets and through fraudulent travel agencies. This research is qualitative in nature, informed by interviews with law enforcement and industry stakeholders, as well as the analysis of a marketplace where fraudulently obtained tickets are traded. This research considers: the nature of the criminal market for fraudulently obtained tickets, the involvement of co-offending and organized crime, the geographic nature of travel fraud, and the ways in which those supplying fraudulently obtained tickets try to avoid detection. Also considered is how the nature of travel fraud has changed over time, ways in which it may continue to change, and the challenges faced by law enforcement.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay063/5094543?rss=1","2018-09-10 16:02:20","50","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"

HoL refers to leaders&rsquo; health-specific orientation toward followers and includes behavioural as well as motivational and cognitive aspects. We tested whether HoL has a direct effect on police officers&rsquo; mental and physical health and whether this relationship is mediated by work-related health behaviours of the officers themselves. Data were collected at a large urban police department in Germany (<span>n</span> = 811). Results indicate that HoL is negatively related to levels of burnout, depression and physical complaints among police officers and is positively related to their state of well-being. The relationship between leadership and well-being was partially mediated by the officers&rsquo; own health-related behaviours, indicating that HoL also affects followers&rsquo; well-being by promoting health-related self-care at work. The results emphasize the importance of leadership for follower health and provide valuable information for leadership development in the context of police work.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay067/5094542?rss=1","2018-09-10 16:02:20","82","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"

Language Analysis in UK Asylum Applications of Syrian Refugees","This article examines current LADO (Language Analysis for the Determination of Origin) practice as documented in a sample of recent reports that assess the speech of Syrian asylum seekers. I show how a method that purports to ensure transparency of data, and contextualisation of the analysis in published research, presents certain problems by framing the question of linguistic background as two juxtaposed hypotheses. I suggest that this approach risks biasing the results by excluding the possibility that speech can be varied and multi-layered. At the same time, points of concern around LADO procedures raised by researchers, such as analysts' inadequate qualifications and failure to take variation into account, are resonating with the judicial system via arguments presented in counter-expertise reports. I argue in favour of an inductive approach to language analysis that draws on a holistic dialect-geographical assessment while giving consideration to sociolinguistic and discourse analytical dimensions.","https://journals.equinoxpub.com/index.php/IJSLL/article/view/35710","2018-09-10 21:01:14","57","International Journal of Speech Language and the Law"

                  <span>
                    <h3>Purpose</h3>
                    <p>One underrepresented area of research within the developmental and life course framework is how criminal careers vary across racial and ethnic lines. Similarly, little is known about how the processes surrounding leaving a youth gang differ based on the experiences of racial and ethnic minorities. This manuscript will help fill this gap in both bodies of literature by examining differences in push and pull motivations for gang desistance across black, Hispanic, and white youth who reside in seven different cities across the USA.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>The mixed-method analysis relies on grounded theory techniques to identify themes in the qualitative interviews as well as provides a quantitative comparison of gang desistance motivations.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>Black youth were least likely to report pulls associated with prosocial attachments and were also least likely to report being disillusioned with intragang relationships. Hispanic youth most commonly reported pulls associated with parental encouragement and experiencing official sanctions and pushes centered on direct and vicarious violent experiences. White youth most commonly reported pulls associated with having a significant other and pushes including feelings of disillusionment with intragang relationships.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>While there is evidence that street socialization and social isolation uniquely impact the gang desistance decisions of black gang youth, these differences might not be enough to justify race-specific intervention programs.</p>

                  <p>Since 2000, the RYSE center located in Richmond, CA has centered the voices of youth to combat issues in their local community. Youth Participatory Action Research (YPAR) has been one of the key tenets of RYSE&rsquo;s approach and implementation of <em>radical inquiry</em>. RYSE&rsquo;s radical inquiry strategy aims to shift what research looks like, sounds like, and feels like with an inquiry process that is humanizing and moves toward liberation. This involves ongoing listening and dynamic responsiveness to the priorities, needs, and interests of young people of color. This commentary documents two recent YPAR projects that developed from youth who were interested in exploring gender-based violence, bullying and coping. The commentary documents findings and youth reflections highlighting the liberatory and collaborative nature of YPAR.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-9995-y","2018-09-11 08:16:26","54","Journal of Family Violence"

The aim of this article is to examine the particular relevance of this partnership in shaping both the recent professionalization and educational agenda of policing in Scotland. It will critically explore these collaborative efforts, particularly in relation to the development of Higher Educational Routes into the service and suggest that while there are benefits to this partnership approach, a co-operative rather than collaborative style emerged in this specific case study.

I discuss how the respective roles and responsibilities of municipal and regional police chiefs and their police governing authorities, and the relationships between them, have evolved and changed over this period. I also discuss comparable developments in the relations between commissioners of the Ontario Provincial Police and provincial ministers responsible for policing in the province during the same period. The arguments and justifications that have been advanced for these developments by politicians, commissions of inquiry, police scholars, and representative bodies of police chiefs and police governing authorities, as well as in key court decisions, are reviewed, and their implications for the concept of &lsquo;police independence&rsquo; are discussed. I conclude that although that concept has been the subject of much critique during these years, it so far remains intact as the key principle underlying police governance and accountability in Ontario.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay062/5094954?rss=1","2018-09-11 15:02:14","131","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"

                  <p>In this study, we examine recidivism in a cohort of 471 registered, adult female sexual offenders for an average follow-up of 18.83&nbsp;years. About half (52%) of the female sexual offenders were re-arrested for a subsequent offense during the follow-up period. Nine percent were re-arrested for a violent offense, and 7 % were re-arrested for a sexual offense. Recidivists for any offense, compared to non-recidivists, were younger, had more extensive criminal histories, and were more likely to have a sexual assault as an index offense. Recidivists for violent (non-sexual) offenses, compared to non-recidivists, were younger, had more extensive criminal histories, and were more likely to have a male victim for an index offense. Recidivists for sexual offenses, compared to non-recidivists, had more prior arrests for any offense, more prior arrests for alcohol/drug offenses, and were more likely to have an acquaintance victim for an index offense.

Testing An Intelligence-Led Policing Tool","Policing: An International Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine whether threat assessment, an intelligence-led policing (ILP) tool, can prevent mass public shootings.   Design/methodology/approach In order to gauge the potential effectiveness of this ILP tool, the authors conduct a retrospective analysis of 278 mass public shootings that occurred in the USA between 1966 and 2016. This retrospective analysis allows us to determine how successful threat assessment protocols could be in preventing mass public shootings by examining how successful this tool would have been in identifying the offenders in the data.   Findings The results show that threat assessment has the potential to be an effective tool in the ILP arsenal to identify and prevent impending mass public shootings. However, the results also point to several obstacles for the effective implementation of this ILP tool. The underreporting of threats and using the content of threats and characteristics of threateners are problematic in correctly assigning risk. The authors make suggestions for how to overcome these obstacles.   Originality/value This study makes several contributions to the ILP and mass murder field. This is the first study to test the potential effectiveness of an ILP tool to prevent mass public shootings. Additionally, this is one of the first studies to examine the leaks, types, context and follow-though of threats made by mass public shooters in the USA.

                    <p>To examine (1) the long-term effects on reoffending of an individual SST for juvenile delinquents in The Netherlands and (2) whether effects differ by demographic and offense history characteristics.</p>

                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>The present study is a follow-up of a matched control study comparing post-treatment effects of <em>N</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;115 juveniles receiving Tools4U, an SST with a parental component, to <em>N</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;108 control group juveniles receiving treatment as usual (TAU). Analyses were conducted separately for delinquents and truants. Effects in terms of recidivism were assessed using official delinquency data after 6 and 12&nbsp;months and 1.46&nbsp;years after SST termination.

                    <p>Tools4U was not more effective than TAU in preventing recidivism, which may be explained by a generally low percentage of recidivists. With established treatment integrity, and a lack of well-researched effective treatment alternatives, Tools4U could still be a reasonable treatment option for <em>adolescent onset</em> juvenile offenders, although more research is needed to confirm this.</p>

"12274","Personality Disordered Offendersâ€™ Experiences of Completing Social Skills Treatment","Journal of Criminological Research, Policy and Practice, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose Although support exists for the effectiveness of treatment for personality disordered offenders there is limited knowledge about the processes underlying the therapeutic change. The purpose of this paper is to explore the treatment experiences of six male psychopathic offenders who attended a social skills treatment component implemented within a high-secure personality disorder treatment service.   Design/methodology/approach Interview transcripts were analysed by the lead researcher (first author) using interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) who compared and contrasted findings to develop superordinate themes across the group. External auditing analysis was conducted by the second author.   Findings Several themes were identified that may indicate the unique ways this client group experienced treatment. These related to the importance of â€œgroup cohesionâ€ with treatment progression and shared learning experiences, the significance of â€œtherapeutic allianceâ€ with treatment providers and perceived effectiveness of treatment, and the conflict participants experienced when acquiring and applying skills from their engagement in treatment. Participants identified aspects of the treatment component that facilitated the effectiveness of treatment and were effective in meeting their needs and some that would benefit from improvement.   Practical implications Positive group dynamics are important. Operational staff inclusion within the facilitation team is beneficial. Attentiveness to participantsâ€™ specific responsivity needs is required. Supporting skill application post-treatment is important.   Originality/value These findings add to the evidence base in relation to factors that support personality disordered offendersâ€™ engagement within treatment. Areas that validate treatment delivery are highlighted, as are suggestions for change to maximise treatment gain for psychopathic and personality disordered offenders.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JCRPP-11-2017-0038?af=R","2018-09-14 08:16:18","31","Journal of Criminological Research, Policy and Practice"
"12275","Mapping Repeated Interviews","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>The present study introduces an adaptation of the Griffiths Question Map (GQM; Griffiths and Milne <span>2006</span>) which extends the chronological, visual map of question types used in an investigative interview to include child interviewee&rsquo;s responses (through the addition of the Interview Answer Grid, IAG). Furthermore, it provides a rare evaluation of repeated interviews with children. From a sample of transcripts of Scottish repeated interviews with child victims, two &lsquo;good&rsquo; and two &lsquo;poor&rsquo; first interviews were chosen based on interviewer question types. First and second investigative interviews of these four children were mapped using the GQM and IAG in order to examine across the two interviews the similarity of interviewer and interviewee behaviours and the consistency and investigative-relevance of information provided. Both &lsquo;good&rsquo; and &lsquo;poor&rsquo; interviews were found to include practices discouraged by interviewing guidelines, which would not have been identified by examining question proportions alone. Furthermore, &lsquo;good&rsquo; first interviews were followed by second interviews which began with poor question types, suggesting a possible impact of confirmation bias. Social support was also assessed and found to be used infrequently, mainly in response to the child being informative rather than pre-emptively by interviewers in an attempt to encourage this. Children were also found to disclose throughout their second interviews, suggesting that rapport-maintenance is vital for single and multiple interviews. The use of the GQM and IAG is encouraged as a technique for determining interview quality.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9288-7","2018-09-14 09:16:44","82","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"

                  <span>
                    <h3>Objectives</h3>
                    <p>The purpose of this study was to compare procedural justice and legitimacy as correlates and predictors of compliance with the law.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>A literature review produced 64 studies, 95 samples, and 196 effect sizes from studies published or conducted sometime between 1990 and February 2018 in which procedural justice was correlated with legitimacy and/or compliance, or legitimacy was correlated with compliance. Fifty samples included all 3 correlations, 3 samples included 2 correlations, and the remaining 42 samples included a single correlation. Two random effects meta-analyses were performed.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>Pooled univariate effects for all three correlations achieved significance. Although there was a high degree of heterogeneity in the results and modest evidence of publication bias in one of the subsamples, sensitivity testing indicated that no one study had an undue influence over the results. Using a generalized least squares (GLS) multivariate approach, a path analysis revealed a significant <em>a</em> path from procedural justice to legitimacy, a significant <em>b</em> path from legitimacy to compliance, and a significant <em>c</em>&rsquo; path from procedural justice to compliance, but only the <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> paths were significant when the analysis was restricted to studies with longitudinal data.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>The current findings suggest that legitimacy beliefs are instrumental in promoting compliance with the law and that while procedural justice perceptions also appear to predict compliance, the effect was relatively weak in this meta-analysis and could not be reliably established in longitudinal datasets.</p>

"12279","Bio-Smuggling in Turkey","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>Turkey is among the countries with the richest biodiversity in Europe and the Middle East; it ranks ninth in the European continent in terms of biodiversity. Its distinct and varied geography affords a high level of endemism and genetic diversity. Due to its high level of endemism and genetic diversity, Turkey is also a center of attraction in terms of genetic resources. This raises the issue of bio-smuggling, which is a significant problem that threatens both the biodiversity and the economic future of the country. The insufficiency of legal, political and institutional systems are a major determining factor on the problem of bio-smuggling in Turkey. Although there are 50 different legislations (11 different international conventions, 14 different laws, 2 different statutory decrees, and 23 different specific regulations) germane to bio-smuggling, between 2002 and 2015 59 incidents of bio-smuggling were documented. Prevention of bio-smuggling in Turkey has remained low and insufficient. With this study, we will review and examine several case examples: legal ramifications of combatting bio-smuggling; pertinent national regulations; legal and administrative sanctions against bio-smuggling and their effectiveness.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10611-018-9794-7","2018-09-14 16:15:33","44","Crime, Law and Social Change"

                  <p>In this article, two case studies of large-scale bid rigging in the construction industry in Canada and the Netherlands are analysed to explore why business cartels sometimes do and sometimes do not involve organised crime. By combining concepts from both organised crime and organisational crime, an integrated understanding of the organisation of serious crimes for gain is applied. Across time and space, businesses in the construction industry are known to fix prices, use collusive tendering and divide market shares in illegal cartel agreements. In order to stabilise cartels, participants need to ward off new competitors and prevent cheating within the cartel. The question why we see a system of collusion involving organised crime and violence in Canada as opposed to the Netherlands is answered through analysing two comparable cases. This article finds two systems of bid rigging emerge under different cultural conditions: inclusive and exclusive collusion. The exclusive system makes use of the violent reputation provided by criminal groups and distinguishes from the inclusive system that uses sophisticated administration of mutual claims in shadow bookkeeping.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12117-018-9350-y","2018-09-15 07:17:12","49","Trends in Organized Crime"

                  <p>Much of the literature on illegal labour focuses on the exploitation of illegal migrants and, by extension, the trafficking and smuggling networks that transport them to destination countries. Using evidence from two projects that investigated working conditions in the formal service economy, the paper presents evidence of &lsquo;off the books&rsquo; work, illegal employment practices such as denial of benefits and the minimum wage, as well as work trials where labour is exploited for free. By considering political economic imperatives, this paper argues that employees in both the formal and informal economy are dispossessed of rights, pay, benefits and security in order for employers to profit by surplus value and the circulation of capital. The real &lsquo;organised crime&rsquo; of illegal labour is neoliberal political economy and its decimation of employment protection.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12117-018-9351-x","2018-09-15 07:17:12","31","Trends in Organized Crime"

                  <p>Child welfare professionals frequently serve families experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV). As such, collaboration with other types of providers as part of a larger network of IPV responders is often necessary, though can be challenging for various reasons. The present study explores child welfare workers&rsquo; perspectives on collaboration challenges specific to child welfare cases that also involve IPV. Data were drawn from the fourth wave of&nbsp;the Florida Study of Professionals for Safe Families, a longitudinal study of child welfare workforce retention. Authors explored qualitative short responses of 493 child welfare workers with active caseloads who reported ever working on cases with IPV. Participants cited communication, complexity of IPV cases, participation in the collaborative process, and competence as the most challenging aspects of IPV case collaboration. Tensions between child welfare agencies and victim advocacy services were noted throughout. Findings suggest opportunities for sustained engagement to facilitate understanding of responder roles and responsibilities may alleviate some collaboration challenges corroborated by previous research. However, local needs assessments inclusive of all responder roles would better identify community-specific challenges, leading to more tailored intervention strategies to improve responder collaborations.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-0002-4","2018-09-15 20:31:33","30","Journal of Family Violence"

                  <span>
                    <h3>Objectives</h3>
                    <p>The purpose of this study is to extend research on communities and crime by assessing neighborhood variation in mortgage fraud.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>We use proprietary data to generate a measure of mortgage fraud for 2005 through 2008 for 793 census tracts in Chicago.

                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>We find that concentrated disadvantage, percent black, and immigrant concentration are associated with greater levels of mortgage fraud. However, the impact of these factors is largely mediated by subprime lending. In addition, we find mortgages purchased by private entities also lead to greater levels of mortgage fraud. Contrary to expectations, changing loan values are unrelated to mortgage fraud.

                    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>The findings suggest the relationship between neighborhood structural characteristics and mortgage fraud is partially due to a lack of public social control in disadvantaged minority neighborhoods. Future research should build on this study and examine a wider variety of crimes than are traditionally studied at the neighborhood level.

                  <p>Over the past 50&nbsp;years, programs serving intimate partner violence (IPV) survivors have expanded nationally. However, despite IPV program growth service gaps remain, particularly for the most marginalized and vulnerable survivor populations. Emerging practice models call for reimagining current IPV service delivery within an intersectional feminist, trauma-informed framework. An overview of intersectional (e.g.&nbsp;survivor-centered, full-frame, culturally specific) and trauma-informed IPV service approaches will be presented highlighting their shared emphasis on power sharing, authentic survivor-advocate relationships, individualized services, and robust systems advocacy. These approaches have the potential to transform IPV services and narrow service gaps if organizations can embed key elements into program design, implementation and evaluation processes. Recommendations for moving the IPV field forward include: 1) expanding survivors&rsquo; roles/input; 2) strengthening funding streams and organizational commitment to anti-oppressive, survivor-defined, trauma-informed services; 3) forging cross-sector advocacy relationships; and 4) building knowledge through research and evaluation.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-0001-5","2018-09-17 18:31:53","32","Journal of Family Violence"

                  <p>The present study investigates how prison comes across as a culturally constructed imaginary. Drawing on narratological methodologies, the study discusses prison as simultaneously real and imagined in society&rsquo;s ongoing communication with and about itself. Through an investigation of how prison is presented in autobiographical prison literature, the study shows how culturally held fears of imprisonment surface in terms of abjection and uncanniness. Previous prison studies have discussed this in terms of civil death and subsequent resurrection. Unlike previous studies, the present study employs the monstrous-feminine motif as a critical device in order to redefine the understanding of prison as abject and uncanny in patriarchal societies. An implementation of the monstrous-feminine motif enables a reading of the prison&rsquo;s particular form of punishment as one that entails incorporation and assimilation; rather than operating on a patriarchal principle of exclusion.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10612-018-9412-0","2018-09-18 12:31:13","42","Critical Criminology"

                  <p>Gusfield (<span>1963</span>) describes constitutional prohibition as symbolically representing status and not concerned with social control. The importance of this perspective for the prohibition of alcohol rests in the rural, Protestant, native segments of the United States symbolically demonstrating their values publicly through law over that of the urban, Catholic, immigrants. This case study tests the symbolic properties of constitutional prohibition through an analysis of the small German-American, rural, winemaking community of Hermann, MO. I analyze Hermann&rsquo;s major English newspaper, the <em>Advertiser-Courier</em>, during two time periods: 1908 to 1911 and 1918 to 1921 to understand the changes in legislative reform and the importance of the social environment for each time period. In order to demonstrate the limitations of a strictly symbolic understanding of constitutional prohibition through Gusfield&rsquo;s (<span>1963</span>) status politics paradigm, I utilize the theoretical tools of structural foundations and triggering events (Galliher (<span>1980</span>) 2012) to assess the social origins of prohibition legislation in Missouri. This perspective further demonstrates the instrumental aspects of social control involved during the passage of this law.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10611-018-9793-8","2018-09-20 11:00:28","58","Crime, Law and Social Change"

                  <p>Near repeat signatures of gun violence have been generated exclusively from incidents reported to or discovered by police. However, many gun crimes go unreported. In Trenton NJ, it is believed&nbsp;as many as 60% of all such cases do not come to the police&rsquo;s attention. This research explores near repeat qualities of gun-related violent crime in Trenton using an underutilized dataset, sounds of gunshots from ShotSpotter, allowing us to capture <em>both</em> reported and unreported gun-related violent crime. When examining reported and unreported gun violence, compared to solely relying on reported cases, near repeat signatures are smaller geographically and exhibit larger and more consistent statistically significant effects across temporal bands. Near repeat chains also occur more frequently and include more events. We caution against only using reported events in near repeat analyses. Improved measures of crime may change the character of near repeat events, research findings, and the operational response.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1057/s41284-018-0154-1","2018-09-20 11:47:36","68","Security Journal"

                  <p>This case study discusses the Survivor-Centered Advocacy (SCA) Project, a community-based participatory research (CBPR) project that convened anti-violence advocates from culturally specific communities to design and implement research. The project used a unique approach to build grassroots research capacity and center survivors of intimate partner violence from historically marginalized communities. This approach coalesced into the creation of an exploratory Community-Led Research (CLR) framework that incorporated trauma-informed, research justice and language justice principles. The CLR framework responded to community members&rsquo; desire to lead, rather than simply participate in, the research process. As a result, five studies were designed and executed by practitioners turned community-based researchers, most of whom had never before engaged in research, except as subjects. The CLR framework integrated the skills and experiences of community-based and external researchers, and led to high levels of engagement, rich data, more equitable research processes and innovative research projects.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-9987-y","2018-09-21 09:31:08","53","Journal of Family Violence"

                  <span>
                    <h3>Purpose</h3>
                    <p>While criminologists know a great deal about how marriage and employment affect criminal behavior, scholars remain equivocal about the relationship between the transition to parenthood and desistance. This study seeks to contribute to the literature by (1) exploring gender differences in the transition to parenthood; (2) exploring how women&rsquo;s offending behavior varies across motherhood states (i.e., pregnancy); (3) assessing important contexts of the relationship between parenthood and desistance, such as timing, residency, and parental orientation; and (4) assessing whether these contexts work together as a &ldquo;respectability package&rdquo;.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>I utilize data from The Pathways to Desistance Study, a longitudinal dataset of serious adolescent offenders, and fixed effects models to test whether the transition to parenthood is associated with periods of self-reported criminal desistance.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>This study finds that a binary measure of parenthood is often insufficient for exploring the effects of parenthood. Rather, the contextual nature of parenthood, particularly the timing of transition, residence with a child, and being highly invested in parenthood, reduces one&rsquo;s odds of offending. Additionally, these contexts work together as a parenthood respectability package. However, these results vary by gender and offense type.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>The transition to parenthood, including both pregnancy and motherhood, seems to be an important factor for periods of temporary desistance among women, while the transition to fatherhood is associated with periods of aggressive offending desistance. The contexts of parenthood also work in gendered and offense-specific ways.</p>

                  <p>Crime prevention and its discourse in the USA has been a series of fits and starts since at least the late 1990s. There continues to exist an absence of any driving force giving direction to a true prevention movement. Most major initiatives that could be considered &ldquo;prevention&rdquo; tend to be gut level responses by criminal justice system actors to address existing offending (tertiary prevention) rather than identifying emerging opportunities or prospective problems and developing/initiating true primary or secondary preventive actions. When attempts are made to eliminate initial acts or opportunities to act, there is a marked lack of follow through, leaving only halfhearted attempts. This article attempts to illustrate this failure and the reasons for the failure, and makes suggestions for improving primary and secondary prevention in the future.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1057/s41300-018-0052-9","2018-09-21 16:15:22","40","Crime Prevention and Community Safety"

"12489","Tattoos in Policing: A Survey of State Police Policies","Policing: An International Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose Policing agencies across the USA have cited difficulty recruiting qualified applicants, thus leaving many employment vacancies unfilled. One reason for this challenge may be that those who would make exceptional police officers are barred from employment because of their body art. Varying appearance policies exist concerning tattoos, yet little is known about these policies. The purpose of this paper is to survey the tattoo policies of policing agencies.   Design/methodology/approach The tattoo policies of all 50 state-level policing agencies were reviewed to explore similarities and state-level correlates.   Findings The majority, but not all, of state police have some type of appearance policy targeting tattoos. State policing agencies that have a â€œno visibilityâ€ policy regarding tattoos more often were in states with a low percentage of millennial residents, high percentage of young veterans, men and non-Hispanic white citizens, and low crime; t-tests indicate â€œno visibilityâ€ policy states significantly differed from other states in the percentage of non-Hispanic whites and crime. Further, state policing agencies with a â€œno visibilityâ€ policy tended to be in northeastern states, with southern states having the fewest state policing agencies with such policies, although the Ï‡2 test was non-significant.   Originality/value Despite the ubiquity of tattoos in the American society, the literature is scant with studies of police appearance policies regarding tattoos. This study provides a partial summary of tattoo policies at the state policing level.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-05-2018-0067?af=R","2018-09-22 08:16:44","49","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

                  <p>Intimate partner violence (IPV) is still rampant in Bangladesh despite a strong national legal framework and a range of governmental as well as non-governmental initiatives to tackle violence against women and girls (VAWG). This paper explores the influence of social norms on the persistence of IPV in Bangladesh as well as a possible backlash occurring despite progress in many areas in relation to tackling VAWG. Qualitative data were collected through 40 key informant interviews, 21 in-depth interviews with survivors of IPV and with married men, 11 focus group discussions and seven intergenerational trios, in two districts of Bangladesh and in Dhaka in 2016. With appropriate consent, interviews were recorded, transcribed and translated from Bengali to English and coded using MAXQDA software. A thematic analysis was then carried out on the coded segments. Findings from our study sample suggest that despite increased awareness of their rights, women and girls still face social norms that create barriers to attaining these rights. Effective governmental and NGO programming might, according to study respondents, result in backlash by men, leading also to changing forms of IPV. Our findings also suggest that increased access to economic resources may not always be protective, while increased education, mobility and access to new technology may be increasing IPV behind closed doors. We argue that the tenacity of the discriminatory gender norms that underlie the attitudes and behaviours of people in Bangladesh is a critical factor for understanding why, despite progress in many areas, IPV persists.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-0003-3","2018-09-24 08:31:06","41","Journal of Family Violence"

                  <p>We test the theory of African American offending&rsquo;s (TAAO) proposed mediation pathways of anger and depression between everyday racial discrimination and criminal justice injustices from the police and serious offending. Additionally, we test TAAO&rsquo;s hypothesized moderated mediation association of racial identity on the association between discriminatory experiences and offending via negative emotions. The proposed pathways are assessed utilizing bootstrapped mediation and moderated mediation analytical techniques on a sample of African American youth from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods. Anger is revealed to partially mediate the association between criminal justice injustices and offending. Racial identity modestly moderates this mediation, meaning as racial identity strengthens the association between criminal justice injustices and offending via anger significantly weakens. In other words, a strong positive racial identity provides a modest buffer against the negative consequences of discriminatory encounters with police. No other significant mediation or moderated mediation pathways were found. Results lend reasonable support to TAAO as well as further highlight the need for additional research into how African Americans&rsquo; lived experiences in our racially stratified society uniquely impact their pathways to and resilience against criminal behavior.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12103-018-9453-7","2018-09-24 09:15:04","45","American Journal of Criminal Justice"

                  <p>In the arena of skills training for acting in complex, high-stress environments, situation awareness has been identified as a key characteristic of successful operators. The definition of situation awareness has evolved over time to include psychophysiological state management, stress inoculation, and cognitive components. This paper utilizes a mixed methods design to examine a training program, which claims to combine the aforementioned situation awareness components in protocols developed for military, law enforcement, and private security personnel. Four past participants of the training program completed in-depth, semi-structured interviews about their experience with the training. Subsequently, a training-specific survey was developed to more thoroughly investigate trainees&rsquo; experiences. Survey responses of the program&rsquo;s trainees (<em>n</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;32) were compared to non-program trainees from similar fields (<em>n</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;35) on quantitative measures. Open-ended responses of the program&rsquo;s trainees were qualitatively analyzed. Overall, program trainees were found to perceive the training as positively impacting their situation awareness ability in stressful/threatening situations and non-stressful situations compared to the non-program trainees. Qualitative analyses conducted with the interviews and on open-response survey items provide descriptive explanations for how the training program is perceived to be influencing situation awareness abilities.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9291-z","2018-09-24 10:16:42","44","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"

"12521","Reflections on Community Safety: the Ongoing Precarity of Womenâ€™s Lives","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>In 2007 Jayne Mooney observed that violence against women was a public anathema and a private commonplace all at the same time. In the decade since this observation was made it would not be hard to conclude that the situation remains the same despite the increasing public policy profile afforded to such violence(s). The purpose of this paper is to consider how and why such forceful observations can still be made and it will do so by reflecting on five inter-connected ongoing tensions for the community safety agenda in addressing violence against women. These tensions are: epistemic (who can know what); methodological (how things, like violence against women, can be known); conceptual (how to make sense of what we think we know); saliency (what variables count and when); policy (what can be done in the light of the foregoing issues); and global (the Northern bias endemic in such policies). The paper will suggest that only when debates on community safety fully embrace the implications of these issues will effective in-roads be made into understanding and improving the ongoing precarity of women&rsquo;s lives.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1057/s41300-018-0050-y","2018-09-24 13:15:21","47","Crime Prevention and Community Safety"
"12522","Domestic Extremist Criminal Damage Events: Behaving Like Criminals Or Terrorists?","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>Property damage is a ubiquitous criminal direct action tactic perpetrated by left-wing extremists in Bristol to advance a variety of causes, yet it remains understudied. This study uniquely contributes to the field by analysing the selection of targets for property damage by left-wing extremists in the British town of Bristol. Using police data and online claims of responsibility, this study analyses a number of situational factors providing guardianship at the target locations of 95 Domestic Extremism incidents and compares them with 95 conventional property damage incidents. The results suggest that left-wing extremists do not behave in the same manner as conventional criminals as they fail to conform to theoretical expectations regarding the effect of guardianship on target selection decisions. Instead, Domestic Extremists appear to adhere to decision-making schemas more commonly associated with terrorists. This raises important questions about the relevance and usefulness of these theoretical frameworks for understanding Domestic Extremism.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1057/s41284-018-0153-2","2018-09-24 13:16:57","63","Security Journal"

The analytical tool-kit consists of practice theory and the neo-classical theory of bureaucracy. The empirical material originates in ethnographic observations and semi-structured interviews from different regions in the new police organization in Sweden. Three themes are outlined: structural sanctification, job crafting, and resilience in work practices. At the end of the article, some reflections on shared leadership are presented, focusing on discretionary powers in police work.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay069/5106392?rss=1","2018-09-25 11:46:59","34","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"
"12530","Giving Voice to the Victims of Sexual Assault: the Role of Police Leadership in Organisational Change","Policing: An International Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose The purpose of this paper is to evaluate a long-term programme within a police service that sought to transform the policing of adult sexual assault cases through reforming case management and investigation practices, as well as cultural perspectives among staff.   Design/methodology/approach The study is based on a case-study approach of change and reform within a single police service. Fieldwork consisted of more than 240 semi-structured interviews and focus groups with police officers, civilian staff, victim advocates, crown prosecutors, defence lawyers, doctors and staff from victim specialist support agencies. Extensive documentary analysis supplemented the primary findings.   Findings Changes to investigations of sexual assault were perceived to be wide-ranging and deeply embedded, and were regarded positively by police officers, staff and external agencies. These are identified in terms of improvements to initial reporting of offences, the development of more rigorous case management and investigations, and enhanced relations with external support agencies.   Research limitations/implications The study is necessarily limited to one case study and the analysis would be usefully developed through further application to other police services.   Social implications The findings have considerable implications for police leaders and managers and wider society. Victim support and recovery agencies benefit from the reforms outlined, and there are considerable consequences for wider criminal justice that continues to disadvantage victims.   Originality/value The paper has considerable originality since it offers a â€œdeepâ€ and â€œthickâ€ understanding of reform within a particular context. The programme of reform was highly unusual since it was designed and delivered over a ten-year period and addressed many aspects of police organisation.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-03-2018-0037?af=R","2018-09-25 11:47:00","73","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

                  <p>The extractive industries sector is considered to be one of the most prone to illicit financial flows. To date, numerous instruments at the national, regional and international level have been adopted targeting the extractive industries sector or specifically combating illicit financial flows but the effectiveness of these instruments remains uncertain as highlighted with the recent scandals that tarnished this sector. In fact some stakeholders, in particular extractive companies and government officials, are being creative and innovative in order to play with legislations combating these illicit practices and perpetuate illicit financial flows. Playing with the rules of the game is made possible not only through the support of intermediaries but also the availability of legal tools. This article provides a glance at how these actors use the law to abuse and manipulate legal frameworks.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10611-018-9791-x","2018-09-26 09:15:21","23","Crime, Law and Social Change"

"12548","Special Issue on Police Reform: Introduction and Overview","<span>In our 2013 edited collection, <span>Centralizing Forces? Comparative Perspectives on Police Reform in Northern and Western Europe</span> (<a href=""http://academic.oup.com/policing#pay071-B1"">Fyfe <span>et al.</span>, 2013</a>), we brought together a set of country-by-country reflections on a set of then recent, large-scale reforms to the structure and organization of public police institutions. These macro-level reforms were typically presented by policy-makers and politicians as &lsquo;discrete, one-off, linear processes, occurring within a relatively short time period, creating a radical innovation and a break with the past&rsquo; (<a href=""http://academic.oup.com/policing#pay071-B5"">Terpstra and Fyfe, 2013</a>, p. 3). In practice, however, reform is not an event, but a highly complex negotiated and contested process through which strategic ambitions and legislative commitments are shaped and re-shaped as they are put into practice. In our paper on local policing during the early phases of reform in the Netherlands and Scotland (<a href=""http://academic.oup.com/policing#pay071-B4"">Terpstra and Fyfe, 2015</a>), we highlighted the significant &lsquo;implementation gap&rsquo; that had emerged in these jurisdictions between the vision of policing articulated in policy documents and political rhetoric and the reality of arrangements that were being established on the ground. In addition, the process and outcome of these large-scale police reforms are highly dependent on their specific institutional, political, and historical context (<a href=""http://academic.oup.com/policing#pay071-B2"">Stenning and Shearing, 2005</a>). Police reform is generally taking place in complex social configurations and (quasi-)political networks, dependent on changing power relations, shifting agendas, and contrasting perspectives and interests between the relevant actors. The consequence may be that changes created by the reform are often more gradual with greater continuity with the past than was often originally imagined (<a href=""http://academic.oup.com/policing#pay071-B5"">Terpstra and Fyfe, 2013</a>). In most cases, police reform is not only a matter of goal-oriented (policy) intentions, but also of many unintended or even contrary effects. It also implies that the process and the outcome of police reforms can only be understood from a long-term perspective.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay071/5107312?rss=1","2018-09-26 17:02:01","69","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"

                  <p>For the past two decades, rhino poaching has made headline news as the South African and global public increasingly endeared themselves to this species, in part due to their precarious status and conservation plight. On the African continent, whilst rhino-poaching pressure has topped out at the pandemic level, another conservation crime, namely elephant poaching, has surreptitiously amplified and annually been spiraling upwards. As rhino populations have dwindled, and amidst this decline and allied loss of poaching opportunities, wildlife poachers have ostensibly diverted their efforts to other more accessible species. This article highlights the auguring southwardly migrating poaching risk to elephants, the extent to which elephants are becoming a surrogate species for rhinos and/or other forms of wildlife in the context of poaching momentum, effort and economics, and the role that crime displacement and pass&eacute; confidence in reactive intervention paradigms play, as potential drivers, in the continent-wide elephant defaunation.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10611-018-9789-4","2018-09-26 17:30:24","38","Crime, Law and Social Change"

                  <p>Police officers are continuously involved in various roles that prove to be highly stressful and require a developed skill set. Consequently, demands from this career put officers at an increased risk for a range of mental-health related concerns. Although officers who suffer from these mental health concerns may need to seek psychological services, there is, unfortunately, a stigma that surrounds mental health causing officers to be reluctant to seek help. This research examines public perceptions and attitudes toward law enforcement professionals seeking mental health treatment. Findings suggest that when a higher level of self-stigma toward mental health is reported, there is also a higher level of stigma toward law enforcement. Males also showed higher levels of stigma toward officers. Implications of the findings and limitations of the study are discussed.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9293-x","2018-09-27 01:17:14","94","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"

                  <span>
                    <h3>Purpose</h3>
                    <p>The desistance literature identifies many competing explanations for desistance. Equifinality, Cicchetti and Rogosch (<em>Dev Psychopathol</em> 8:597&ndash;600, <span>1996</span>), refers to the idea that a diversity of pathways can lead to the same end result. Embracing this perspective, we shift our focus from identifying effects of causes to identifying the causes of an effect, Sampson et al. (<em>Criminol Public Policy</em> 12:587&ndash;616, <span>2013</span>): desistance. That is, among individuals who have desisted from crime, what proportion have experienced each of the proposed explanations of desistance? Are these proportions any different from non-desisters or other offending groups? In this way, we provide evidence for the relative importance of competing explanations for desistance.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>Using Pathways to Desistance, we estimate group-based trajectory models of offending. We use this model to identify desisters and persisters. We then compare these two groups on theoretically motivated constructs.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>We find that psychosocial development, associations with deviant peers, and the social rewards of crime change more rapidly among desisters than persisters. Many desistance processes are present among persisting groups, but at a slower rate of change compared to desisters.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>Embracing the equifinality of desistance would open up new methodological approaches and new ways of organizing the literature, and would have important implications for theoretical development and policy applications.</p>

                  <p>The present study examines gender differences in the relationship between intergenerational educational mobility and crime using data from The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. Drawing on recent trends in college completion among men and women, as well as theories of social control and general strain, it also examines whether these relationships are mediated by prosocial bonds (i.e., familial and employment status), economic stressors, and social-psychological measures in adulthood. Results suggest that upward mobility is associated with decreases in crime for both gender groups; however, downward mobility is associated with increases in crime only for women. Findings are discussed in the context of the relative importance of a college degree for men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s life chances.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12103-018-9454-6","2018-09-27 08:30:07","26","American Journal of Criminal Justice"

                  <p>During the past 20&nbsp;years, there have been several initiatives, led by the British government, to improve crime prevention by informing policy and practice with research. Two in particular stand out for the scale of the investment: The first was the establishment of the Crime Reduction Programme (CRP) in 1999. The CRP was supposed both to be based on what was already known from research and also to improve the evidence base and was scheduled to run for a decade. The CRP involved an unprecedented financial commitment to improving the knowledge base of crime prevention. The second was the establishment of the What Works Centre for Crime Reduction (WWCCR) in 2013. The WWCCR attempts both to distil findings from high quality research on what works in crime reduction in a form that would be readily accessible to and useable by decision-makers, and to encourage original research to improve the knowledge base. We touch more briefly also on the creation of the National Police Improvement Agency in 2007 and its successor body, the College of Policing in 2013. The core mission of both has been to professionalise policing (including police efforts to reduce crime) by making policing more evidence based, and the College of Policing has been home to WWCCR. This paper will provide a critical account of these major efforts to bring evidence to crime reduction and discuss lessons that can be learned from their experience.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1057/s41300-018-0053-8","2018-09-28 14:30:28","47","Crime Prevention and Community Safety"

Benchmarking the content against extended EBP criteria revealed that graduates attempted to specify issues and engage in consultation, but made relatively limited use of concepts and theory, data analysis or statistical techniques.

"12569","Reintegration Among High-Profile Ex-Offenders","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Purpose</h3>
                    <p>The reintegration of high-profile ex-offenders&mdash;including homicide offenders, pedophiles, and terrorists&mdash;frequently receives great political and public attention. This raises several important questions: how do such offenders reintegrate into society after their release? What is the impact of their prison sentence and media attention on life domains post-release? And, given their presence in the public eye, how do current life course theories account for desistance among this special group?</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>Based on in-depth life course interviews with ten Dutch high-profile ex-offenders and interviews with 17 professionals involved in their reintegration, this study seeks to address a significant gap in academic literature on the role of public attention on reentry and desistance.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>While none of the subjects reengaged in criminal behavior, all of them significantly struggled in the domains of family relations, parenthood, intimate partner relationships, employment, and housing post-release. This poses challenges in terms of explaining their desistance through life course theory alone. They are frequently in the public eye, which&mdash;combined with strict supervision&mdash;inhibits them from rebuilding relationships that may act as informal social controls.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>Findings emphasize the significance of the broader social context of high-profile offenders as well as factors such as time and age, for gaining an understanding of their lived experiences and desistance.</p>

                  <p>This is the first study in South Africa to investigate the association of violence against children with human capital development, including short- and long-term health and educational outcomes. Hypotheses were tested by applying logistic regressions, zero inflated poisson regressions, linear regressions and ordered logistic regressions with a large and representative sample of adolescents from the Cape Area Panel Study (CAPS). Household fixed effects model and treatment-effects model were performed to check the robustness of the results. Analyses indicate that 58% of adolescents in South Africa have experienced physical or emotional violence in childhood. All forms of violence, especially physical violence, are associated with adverse physical and mental health, poorer academic achievement and lower education level of the victims in both the short and long term. Adolescent males who have experienced violence in childhood are more likely to report poorer educational outcomes and long-term physical health, while female victims are at higher risk of mental illness. The findings provide support for the negative effects of violence against children on health and educational outcomes, which lead to increasing inequalities that impact on the future development of South Africa. Urgent violence against children prevention programming is needed alongside health and educational initiatives in the country.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-0008-y","2018-09-29 19:31:04","43","Journal of Family Violence"
"12573","â€œShe Is His Girlfriendâ€”i Believe This Is A Different Situationâ€: Gender Differences in Perceptions of the Legality of Intimate Partner Rape","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>Despite the alarming problem of intimate partner rape (IPR), there is a dearth of empirical data investigating how jury-eligible individuals perceive IPR in a courtroom setting. In particular, very little research has addressed IPR beyond the scope of marital rape. Thus, we investigated how community members perceived intimate partner rape involving both a married and non-married couple in a mock trial context. In Experiment 1, 129 participants (78 women) read a trial summary describing an intimate partner rape that differed as to whether the victim and defendant were married or in a cohabiting, non-marital relationship. In Experiment 2, which involved the same methods as Experiment 1, we gave 153 participants (79 women) four verdict options: not guilty, guilty of Rape in the First-Degree, Intimate Partner Rape, or Sexual Misconduct. In both experiments, women were more likely to render guilty verdicts than men and yielded more pro-victim/anti-defendant judgments. Participants did not perceive the case differently between the marital status conditions. In Experiment 2, the presence of other guilty verdict choices influenced both men and women&rsquo;s guilt decisions. The proportion of women who found the defendant not guilty of any crime decreased by over 50% in Experiment 2, while the proportion of men who found the defendant not guilty remained stable across experiments. The results suggest that few men and women are willing to convict the defendant of Rape in the First-Degree&mdash;especially when presented with other, lesser sexual crime options&mdash;and that the victim and defendant&rsquo;s intimate relationship is a mitigating factor causing mock jurors to view IPR as a lesser, sexual crime different to felony rape.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-0006-0","2018-09-30 03:16:08","33","Journal of Family Violence"

                  <span>
                    <h3>Purpose</h3>
                    <p>In the present paper, we test whether academic factors differentially predict violent offending, based on &ldquo;differential etiology of violence&rdquo; hypothesis as proposed by Savage and Wozniak (<em>Thugs and Thieves: The Differential Etiology of Violence</em>, [<span>58</span>]).</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>We use data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health. We used a three-tier statistical approach to test the differential etiology of violence thesis. First, we compared the slopes of coefficients generated by ordinary least squares regression models. Second, we examined negative binomial regression partial coefficients estimating the association between academic achievement and violent offending, controlling for nonviolent offending. Finally we used binary logistic regression to compare &ldquo;any violent&rdquo; to &ldquo;nonviolent-only&rdquo; offenders.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>The findings suggest that academic achievement, but not school attachment, is differentially associated with violent behavior in longitudinal, conservative models. Grade average is lower and several indicators of school problems are higher among violent offenders than nonviolent-only offenders, and GPA distinguishes violent from chronic, nonviolent-only offenders in models that control for a host of social factors as well as intelligence (measured with a picture vocabulary test), ADHD, alcohol, and drug use.</p>

                  <span>
                    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>The findings are consistent with the differential etiology of violence thesis, challenging the adequacy of general theories of offending and calling into question the assumption that the causes of violent offending are identical to those of nonviolent offending. Policy implications of these findings include the possibility that academic measures and programs might be used to target and address violent behavior problems; theoretical implications include a call for criminological theories specific to violence and appropriate tests of those theories.</p>

                  <p>Confrontations between police officers and civilians are sometimes videoed and made available to the public. In two experiments, we examined emotional regulation of such videos. Participants viewed a video of a confrontation between a police officer and a civilian and were asked if the officer used excessive force. In experiment 1, we investigated whether the information provided to participants prior to watching a police officer-civilian confrontation video (pre-video information: yes, no) might create a context that would allow them to regulate their emotional responses to the video. Additionally, we examined how that context might affect their judgments of excessive force used by the officer in the video. Results of experiment 1 showed that pre-video warnings influenced excessive force judgments. Results also showed that excessive force judgments were related to the amount of time it took participants to make the excessive force judgments: participants took less time to make a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; than a &ldquo;no&rdquo; excessive force judgment. In experiment 2, we investigated both the influence of pre-video information and appraisal time on excessive force judgments: participants in different groups were required to withhold their excessive force judgments for different periods of time (appraisal times 0&nbsp;s, 3&nbsp;s, 8&nbsp;s, 13&nbsp;s). Results of experiment 2 revealed an interaction between pre-video information and appraisal time on excessive force judgments. Excessive force judgments decreased with appraisal time but only when participants were given pre-video information. We think our results have implications for how people may process police officer-civilian confrontation videos when viewing them on the news.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9295-8","2018-10-01 13:16:48","31","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"

Most impact assessments are based on projects within one geographical area or jurisdiction. Yet, the results are sometimes seen as an answer to the general question: &lsquo;Do bodycams work: yes or no?&rsquo; In the first part of this article, I present a meta-analysis aggregating nine impact assessments from three different countries. The average results are positive prompting the conclusion that bodycams work. However, the overwhelming majority of research on bodycams comes from the United States or the United Kingdom. As police forces in other countries try to copy successful projects from abroad, they quickly discover that bodycams are about much more than just the technology. All bodycam programs need careful preparation and attention to implementation to enable the devices to work as intended. By looking at effectiveness from this perspective, a different question appears from underneath the average results: &lsquo;How do bodycams work, under what conditions and for whom?&rsquo; In the second part of the article, I sketch a framework to help science and practice to answer this much more relevant and realistic question. Central tenets within this framework are mechanisms, context and implementation. The final part of the article focuses on two topics that are often overlooked, but might prove essential in the quest for transferable lessons on bodycams: the visibility of the bodycam and the guidelines regulating the use of the bodycams.</p>","https://bulletin.cepol.europa.eu/index.php/bulletin/article/view/321","2018-10-01 17:45:45","39","European Law Enforcement Research Bulletin"

"12607","Effectiveness of Simulation-Based Learning in Basic Police Training","<p>Simulation-based learning is an important element of police training and further education. In the Bavarian police system (Germany), the curriculum of basic training includes 500 hours of simulation-based training for apprentices. This considerable amount of training necessitates a great deal of facilities and human resources. After a long period of practical experience, we investigated a training evaluation study in cooperation with the University of W&uuml;rzburg (Germany) to measure the effectiveness of the simulation-based training in Bavarian police officer trainees.</p> <p>The results of the study indicate that the simulation-based training appears to be both subjectively and objectively effective.</p> <p>Regarding measures of objective training success, trainees&rsquo; performance in factual and applied knowledge significantly increased over time in the simulation-based training.</p> <p>The largest effects of objective performance scores were found in the practical application of security law, criminal law, police operation competence, and communication/conflict management.</p> <p>Regarding measures of subjective training success, we found a highly significant increase in effectiveness over time in simulation-based training, with the highest effects found in trainees&rsquo; perceived usefulness, individual results, contentment, self-efficacy, and practical application.</p> <p>To optimize simulation-based learning activities, more constructive feedback by trainers is necessary in terms of information about the individual learning process. Additionally, more standardization across trainers, classes, training modules, and different training centers is necessary.</p> <p>We conclude that role playing as a form of simulation-based learning is effective in basic police training, even in the long term. When combined with traditional classroom training, such simulation-based training can improve police trainees&rsquo; training success.</p>","https://bulletin.cepol.europa.eu/index.php/bulletin/article/view/330","2018-10-01 17:45:45","41","European Law Enforcement Research Bulletin"

                  <p>Although individuals who engage in intimate partner violence (IPV) report high rates of trauma exposure, it is unclear whether they perceive a link between trauma exposures and relationship problems, which traumas are seen as most influential, and whether such perceptions accurately reflect their relationship difficulties. Ninety-four men presenting for IPV intervention services reported their exposure to 22 adverse and potentially traumatic events (APTEs), and were asked whether these events had influenced the way that they think, act, or feel in relationships. APTEs were categorized based on whether or not they appeared to represent PTSD Criterion A traumatic events. Additionally, participants completed self-report measures of IPV use, partner injuries, emotional abuse, relationship problems, emotion regulation difficulties, and PTSD symptoms. Nearly half (43.6%) of the sample reported that one or more APTEs had influenced the way they function in relationships. Of the 92 reports of non-Criterion A APTEs, 42.4% were endorsed as relationship-influencing, whereas only 19.7% of the 310 occurrences of Criterion A APTEs were endorsed as relationship-influencing. The number of relationship-influencing APTEs reported was positively correlated with emotional abuse, relationship problems, emotion regulation difficulties, and PTSD symptoms. In contrast, the number of non-relationship-influencing APTEs reported was only correlated with emotional abuse. Findings from this exploratory study (1) demonstrate the ability of clients receiving IPV services to discern which APTEs have relevance to their relationships; (2) suggest the benefits of considering non-Criterion A APTEs; and (3) indicate the need for trauma- informed IPV intervention services.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-0004-2","2018-10-01 20:16:08","35","Journal of Family Violence"
"12613","The Association Between Paternal Job Stress and Maternal Child Corporal Punishment: Evidence From A Population-Based Survey in Metropolitan Japan","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>Although child corporal punishment can lead to adverse health outcomes in children, this practice remains prevalent in Japan. This study investigates whether, under Asian family norms, fathers&rsquo; job stress is a risk factor for mothers&rsquo; frequent use of child corporal punishment. A study sample of 522 children ages 0 to 6&nbsp;years was obtained from a population-based survey in Tokyo. Data from mothers&rsquo; self-reports of maternal caretaker child corporal punishment were regressed on paternal job stress using logistic regression analysis. Covariates include child age (months), child gender, number of children in the household, maternal education, maternal adverse childhood experiences, and annual household income. Maternal psychological distress was hierarchically included in the model. Paternal job stress was significantly associated with maternal frequent use of child corporal punishment independent of maternal psychological distress and other known risk factors such as child&rsquo;s age, maternal education, and maternal adverse childhood experiences. The results indicate that job stress may be a risk factor for parental child corporal punishment. Employers can contribute to improving children&rsquo;s health and safety in the household by designing workforce policies to reduce employee&rsquo;s stress and by offering psychoeducational programs for parents.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-0005-1","2018-10-01 23:31:35","28","Journal of Family Violence"
"12614","Examining the Needs and Experiences of Domestic Violence Survivors in Transitional Housing","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>Transitional Housing (TH) programs were developed for domestic violence (DV) survivors in order to provide the time, financial assistance, and supports needed for survivors to achieve long-term safety and housing stability. Previous research indicates TH may be effective for homeless families, but there is a paucity of evidence related to DV survivors&rsquo; need for or use of TH. TH is an expensive housing intervention that is space limited and requires survivors to relocate at program end. It is therefore imperative to understand who is best suited for, interested in, and helped by DVTH. Thirty current survivors in a DVTH program were interviewed in order to elucidate the benefits and drawbacks of DVTH. The interviews were semi-structured, and both quantitative and qualitative data were collected. Survivors in severe danger from their abusive partners and ex-partners, those with greater psychosocial needs, and immigrant survivors identified aspects unique to DVTH (e.g., high-level security, intensive services) as being critical to their safety and well-being. A small number of survivors would have chosen a less intensive and structured housing option, such as Rapid Re-housing (RR), that would have allowed them to remain in their housing after assistance ended, had such an option been available. DVTH appears to be an important option for some DV survivors, but more housing options are needed across communities to meet survivors&rsquo; myriad needs.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-0010-4","2018-10-01 23:31:35","36","Journal of Family Violence"

The purpose of this paper is to examine how experimental manipulation of online recruitment materials impacts potential applicants.   Design/methodology/approach The study relied on a census of 11 criminal justice courses taught at a public university, asking students to respond to an experimental vignette instrument (n=174). The 3Ã—2 experimental vignette involved manipulation of two variables: the identification of recruits with diversity language (â€œindividuals,â€ â€œwomen and menâ€ or â€œa diverse group of individualsâ€) and mention or absence of discussion of physical fitness requirements.   Findings Results largely run counter to prior research concerning women in policing, with women actually indicating increased probability of providing their contact information when encountering vignettes with physical fitness requirements.   Originality/value This study demonstrates that small manipulations of recruitment content can have significant and gendered impact on potential applicants.

Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted several focus groups and follow-up interviews with executive and operational members of Australiaâ€™s principal fusion centres and related environments.   Findings The authors argue that in order to understand the internal dynamics of fusion centres, and the ways in which they form and function, the analysis of interrelationships between partners and potential partners is critical. The authors have demonstrated that a network model can assist in this type of analysis. For example, hub-and-spoke network structures appear to be a particularly effective solution to the centralisation-density trade-off for such inter-agency networks.

"12617","Intimate Partner Violence-Related Fractures in the United States: An 8Â year Review","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>Fractures associated with intimate partner violence (IPV) are devastating injuries that can have lifelong physical and emotional implications. With exception to the facial region, there are very limited epidemiological reports describing the types and location of IPV-related fractures. The objective of this study is to review a national database and describe trends that are associated with IPV-related fractures. An analysis of all adult (18&nbsp;years and older) was performed using the National Trauma Data Bank from 2007 through 2014. There were 1352 records identified where the patient was diagnosed with an IPVrelated fracture. Women accounted for 83% of the population and the mean age was 37.5&nbsp;years. Nearly half of the population sustained fractures to the face. Variances among fracture location were observed across age groups. Facial fractures were recorded more in the younger population (18&ndash;39&nbsp;years) when compared to the other age groups (40&ndash;59&nbsp;years and 60+ years), <em>p</em>&thinsp;&lt;&thinsp;0.001. Alternatively, rib and femur fractures were more commonly seen among survivors aged 60&nbsp;years and older when compared to the younger age groups, <em>p</em>&thinsp;&lt;&thinsp;0.001. The ability to identify and respond to survivors of IPV in the healthcare setting is critically important. While facial fractures are particularly common in the presence of IPV, they are not the only type of fractures that may be seen. In many cases healthcare professionals are the first line of defense in identifying suspected IPV cases. The findings of this paper build upon existing literature while also describing IPV-related fractures across the age spectrum.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-0007-z","2018-10-03 00:16:06","28","Journal of Family Violence"

                  <p>Despite many studies on police stress, there is little research on interventions to promote their well-being. Moreover, most studies of police stress have been predominately on male samples, with female police officers often being neglected. On this premise, the purpose of the present study was to develop and determine the efficacy of resilience training program by evaluating its impact on occupational stress, resilience, job satisfaction, and psychological well-being. Two hundred and fifty female police officers from the Southern part of India were recruited for the study. The study adopted a pre-post-follow-up research design. Resilience training with components such as self-awareness, positive attitude, emotional management, and interpersonal skills were developed uniquely for this study, based on protective model of resilience. Sixty-three female police officers, who fulfilled the criteria, were randomly assigned into two groups namely, experimental (<em>n</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;33) and control group (<em>n</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;30). Resilience training was given to the experimental group thrice a week for nearly 2&nbsp;months, and control group was not given any training. Data were collected at three time periods, i.e., before training, a week after training, and 2&nbsp;months after training. The statistical analysis, using repeated measures analysis of variance (RMANOVA) was carried out. The results revealed that resilience training was effective in enhancing resilience, job satisfaction, and psychological well-being of female police officers and in reducing occupational stress. Medium effect sizes were reported. The qualitative feedback was positive regarding the resilience training program, supporting the empirical evidence for the effectiveness of resilience training program. The study had implications for theory and practice in police research.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9294-9","2018-10-03 18:18:40","33","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"
"12626","Promoting Pirate Prisons: Exploring the Intersections of Narratives, Media, and Criminal Justice Reform in East Africa","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>In March of 2011, several news media outlets published articles announcing the opening of a &ldquo;pirate prison&rdquo; in the northwest region of Somalia. Over the next five years, news articles about East African prisons holding piracy prisoners en masse were among the few ways in which the public came to <em>know</em> pirate prisons&mdash;what they look like, who they punish, and how they punish. Our analysis of the text and imagery in news articles about these prisons reveals that pirate prison narratives reflects the unique political, social, and economic issues of each location. The geographically-specific narratives are created, promoted, and in some cases silenced by different actors and entities to shape public perception of pirate prisons and motivate funding decisions. This case study aims to theorize what these pirate prison narratives tells us more broadly about the complexities underlying the promotion of criminal justice reforms in the media and the political economy of punishment in East Africa. We contend that the production and maintenance of particular pirate prison narratives helps various actors and agencies maximize benefits tied to a broader penal market where piracy prisoners are detained and transferred in exchange for development aid.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10611-018-9796-5","2018-10-03 23:30:25","32","Crime, Law and Social Change"
"12627","Intimate Partner Violence: Gender Issues and the Adjudication of Homicide and Other Cases","Journal of Criminological Research, Policy and Practice, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of gender in intimate partner violence (IPV) and, based upon the authorâ€™s experience as an expert witness, 25 years of clinical experience working with IPV perpetrators and victims, and a review of the relevant scholarly literature, provide judges, attorneys, mental health professionals and expert court witness suggestions for the adjudication of cases involving IPV in homicide and other cases.   Design/methodology/approach The author reviewed the extant general domestic violence research literature, depending largely on results from findings from the Partner Abuse State of Knowledge Project, a series of 17 literature review published in five issues of the peer-reviewed journal, Partner Ause. Other relevant research articles were found via a search of the PschInfo database, using the keywords â€œintimate partner homicides,â€ â€œdomestic violence homicides,â€ â€œintimate partner homicides and genderâ€ and â€œdomestic violence homicides and gender.â€   Findings The judicial response to IPV perpetration has been limited by common misconceptions, among them the confusion between most forms of IPV, which are primarily bi-directional and less consequential and battering, which involves more serious assaults and is typically motivated out of a desire to dominate and control oneâ€™s partner. Another misconception is that women are much more likely than men to perpetrate IPV in self-defense or to express emotion. On the other hand, there is no question that female victims are much more likely to experience severe physical injuries, and that women account for approximately three-quarters of homicide victims.   Practical implications These include the following: this concise review of IPV research provides a clearer understanding of IPV, useful for anyone working in the field. Mental health professionals working with IPV perpetrators, as well as victims, can draw from this research best practice suggestions in working with more problematic cases. The paper should be especially useful to anyone involved in the adjudication of IPV cases, including lethal cases. In particular, prosecutors and attorneys working for the defense are given suggestions on how to obtain more reliable research data, choose more fruitful questions for their clients, and better conceptualize a case overall.   Originality/value This paper presents a more nuanced and evidence-based conceptualization of serious and lethal IPV, drawing on a broad research base not generally available to members of the legal profession.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JCRPP-01-2018-0008?af=R","2018-10-04 07:46:00","54","Journal of Criminological Research, Policy and Practice"
"12628","Treatment of Psychopathy: A Conceptual and Empirical Review","Journal of Criminological Research, Policy and Practice, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose For decades, psychopathy has been thought to be untreatable. Yet, conceptualisations, and indeed its assessment, have deviated away from viewing the disorder as personality pathology towards a behavioural focus where the core underlying deficits in cognition and affect have been ignored. Interventions have followed suit leading to a premature discounting of the role of therapy in adjusting psychopathic traits. The paper aims to discuss these issues.   Design/methodology/approach The review critically evaluates the conceptual and empirical evidence relevant to the treatment of psychopathy, deciphering components integral to the disorder that require intervention. Psychopathy is approached from a developmental perspective, with the review identifying several mechanisms thought to be responsible for precipitating and perpetuating its expression.   Findings There appears some utility in targeting psychopathy from multiple angles, addressing experiences of trauma, associated schemas and the underlying cognitive-affective dysfunction noted to give rise to psychopathic traits. A new model for treatment was proposed integrating these factors to encourage the design of effective interventions that will address the origins and underlying deficits of the disorder, rather than symptomology.   Originality/value The review encourages future research to consider the aetiology of psychopathy, with the aim of informing early intervention and containing the disorder whilst in its infancy, as well as addressing neurobiological dysfunction when most malleable.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JCRPP-06-2018-0019?af=R","2018-10-04 08:16:02","100","Journal of Criminological Research, Policy and Practice"

                    <h3>Objectives</h3>
                    <p>While many criminological theories posit causal hypotheses, many studies fail to use methods that adequately address the three criteria of causality. This is particularly important when assessing the impact of criminal justice involvement on later outcomes. Due to practical and ethical concerns, it is challenging to randomize criminal sanctions, so quasi-experimental methods such as propensity score matching are often used to approximate a randomized design. Based on longitudinal data from the Cambridge Study in Delinquent Development, the current study used propensity score matching to investigate the extent to which convictions and/or incarcerations in the first two decades of life were related to adverse mental health during middle adulthood.</p>

                  <p>Crime is concentrated at the individual level (hot dots) as well as at area level (hot spots). Research on repeat victimisation affords rich prevention opportunities but has been increasingly marginalised by policy makers and implementers despite repeat victims accounting for increasing proportions of total crime.

                  <p>A growing body of literature has recently begun to examine spatiotemporal nuances of arson. However, criminal justice research has minimally investigated how an arson event might serve as an initiator for a string of arsons. To rectify this gap, the current study conducted a near repeat analysis incorporating multiple-event near repeat chains to identify possible spatiotemporal patterns for arson in Flint, Michigan. Findings underscore that increased risk of repeat arson victimization was most pronounced for residential arsons. Results for near repeat chains indicate an average mean risk of roughly 5&nbsp;days but for certain chains risk lasted for up to 2&nbsp;months. Discussion of implications, limitations, and future research are also provided.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1057/s41284-018-0155-0","2018-10-04 13:17:11","110","Security Journal"

"12650","Changing Perspectives on Guardianship Against Crime: An Examination of the Importance of Micro-Level Factors","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>This paper focuses on how the narrative around guardianship as a crime prevention strategy has evolved from its original roots in macro-level theory and examination predominantly in residential places with a focus on property crime. It first highlights the ways in which some of the most useful insights about how guardianship functions to protect against crime have been illuminated by micro-level studies which have built on macro-level trends. Recent scholarship is used to illustrate how criminological understanding about guardianship against crime has been significantly developed through a focus on micro-level environmental factors and, most recently, individual factors. Perhaps one of the most significant developments in guardianship research in recent years has been its application beyond the residential context to extend to interpersonal crimes (sexual crimes in particular) and to cybercrime (cyberabuse in particular). Conclusions are drawn about how these new developments can be interwoven to advance the theoretical underpinnings of guardianship.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1057/s41300-018-0049-4","2018-10-05 14:15:20","100","Crime Prevention and Community Safety"

                  <p>The objective of this research is to study the personality characteristics of a sample of men and women who are serving prison sentences in Spanish prisons, to determine their distinguishing characteristics, and to analyze whether the personality traits are related to the type of crime for which they are condemned. The sample is composed of 294 inmates (265 men and 29 women) (M&thinsp;=&thinsp;41.20; SD&thinsp;=&thinsp;10.51). The results indicate that the main crime for which they are imprison is for acts against property that involve violence or threat of violence against people (30.4%); to a lesser extent, acts that involve the use of psychoactive substances or other drugs (19.8%); acts that cause harm or that are intended to cause harm to people (17.9%); and acts that cause death or are intended to cause death (13.9%). Paranoia is the personality trait that most predicts criminal behaviors consisting of acts against people (homicide, injuries, and threats). Acts against property involving violence or threat against a person are more likely in people who have problems with alcohol and antisocial behavior. Finally, borderline personality traits are associated more with acts involving controlled psychoactive substances or other drugs.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9296-7","2018-10-06 06:16:36","38","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"

                  <p>Periodic revelations about the workings of data interception, analysis and collection in Canada have each time prompted successive administrations to amend laws and regulations in order to calm public opinion. This has been referred to as &ldquo;accountability through scandal&rdquo; and has, for the most part, produced cosmetic changes rather than significant reform. Most of the practices and the ethos of the organizations have remained the same, setting the stage for the next scandal. This paper reviews the last scandal to befall the Canadian Security Establishment, caused by the Snowden revelations, and the subsequent political response. Approached with part of Foucault&rsquo;s toolbox it becomes clear that the business of the state and state security requires a particular form of &ldquo;management of illegalisms,&rdquo; or differential treatment of rule-breaking, at the higher echelons of state power.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10612-018-9421-z","2018-10-08 14:30:38","40","Critical Criminology"

                  <p>We style ourselves as liberal polities and law purports to sustain liberal values. It does not claim to maintain and perpetuate capitalist goals as such. Yet, its adherence to the sacrosanct nature of private property, individualism and freedom to contract allow it do just that. To further this unmentioned objective, law is twisted and bent to ignore the supposed right of workers as individuals to be autonomous decision-makers. The indefensible assumptions made give capitalists coercive powers that inhibit the working class from achieving economic and political autonomy. The owners of the means of production are given political and economic privileges by a legal system that pretends to serve the liberal project. The contradiction between liberal law and its capitalist orientation is plain, leading to occasional and always transitory reforms. This is illustrated by this overview of the legal mechanism of adjustment devised by supposedly liberal law to regulate capital/labour conflicts.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10612-018-9419-6","2018-10-08 15:30:40","43","Critical Criminology"
"12681","Corporate Colonialism and the â€œCrimes of the Powerfulâ€ Committed Against the Indigenous Peoples of Canada","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>Canada is both a capitalist and colonial society, one founded on the seizing of Indigenous lands for capitalist purposes. In the process, a variety of &ldquo;crimes of the powerful&rdquo; were committed, including the theft of Indigenous lands, the forcible confinement of Indigenous people onto reserves, and the subjection of Indigenous children to physical and sexual assaults via the residential school system. In more recent times, the corporate quest for extractive resources has created further harms for Indigenous communities. The lives of too many Indigenous people in Canada are now contoured by complex poverty, Indigenous children are over-represented in the child welfare system, and Indigenous adults are over-incarcerated in prisons and jails. Using a &ldquo;crime&rdquo; lens, this paper brings an awareness of Canada as a capitalist and colonial society&mdash;conceptualized here as &ldquo;corporate colonialism&rdquo;&mdash;to the foreground. In the process, the various manifestations of the &ldquo;crimes of the powerful&rdquo; against the Indigenous peoples of Canada are exposed.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10612-018-9414-y","2018-10-08 15:30:40","20","Critical Criminology"

                  <p>Corporate influences that threaten the independence of science and trust in research often remain hidden from the general public. For university administrators these improper influences are often tacitly accepted as simply the new reality of funding environments&mdash;something to be managed, rather than eliminated. In this article, we structurally map patterns of corporate influence that threaten to distort the independence of research. Specifically, we map relationships between the fossil fuel industry and three major Canadian institutions of higher education. We also provide case studies of institutional corruption inside two of these universities. Our findings reveal elite interlocking networks between the fossil-fuel sector and academia as well as corporate influences that serve to decrease the independence of science and trust in research.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10612-018-9420-0","2018-10-08 16:30:38","29","Critical Criminology"

                  <p>According to Sutherland the principle difference between white-collar and lower-class crime is in the administrative segregation of white-collar criminals that allows them to be funneled away from the criminal justice system so that they are not viewed by researchers or the public as real criminals. As segregated deviants, they also benefit from the cloak of secrecy that surrounds their administrative outcomes. This paper examines inroads that have been made in requiring the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario to publicize its disciplinary decisions and then contrasts it with the lack of transparency by the College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia. The author reflects on how Access to Information legislation can be used as a methodological strategy to uncover physicians&rsquo; misconduct and the pitfalls that await such an approach.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10612-018-9418-7","2018-10-08 17:30:38","31","Critical Criminology"

"12685","The Organized Irresponsibility Principle and Risk Arbitrage","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>In an age of accelerating wealth at the very top and accelerating risks at the bottom, there is a clear disjunction between the flow of social benefits and social damages produced by different actors and their share of these respective benefits and damages. Yet, the specific processes that generate the dualization of tracks of accumulation of rewards or accumulation of risks and precarity are still up for debate. In tackling this dual process in a way that is attuned to the critical contribution of contemporary forms of the law to this uneven accumulation of wealth and of risks, this paper focuses on <em>organized irresponsibility</em>&mdash;where individuals can cumulatively contribute to risks, but avoid individual culpability&mdash;and how relations of organized irresponsibility provide extensive opportunities for <em>risk arbitrage</em>. Risk arbitrage is correspondingly a process where actors, whether it be individuals or larger organizations, can produce social risk, appropriate benefit from these risks, and disproportionately avoid the consequences of the risks so as to benefit from the overall &ldquo;cycle of reward and risk&rdquo;&mdash;even if society as a whole is worse off. The paper identifies organized irresponsibility as fundamentally undergirded by mismatches between existing configurations of law and the existing complexity of the processes of the production of social goods and risks. This paper proceeds to show how gaps in the law enable <em>the organized irresponsibility principle</em>&mdash;that given a level of risk production, the greater the number of actors involved and the greater complexity between causes and the risk&rsquo;s impacts, the less overall culpability that tends to be assigned. It then shows how the organized irresponsibility principle enables relationships of risk arbitrage that intensify contemporary risk and inequality.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10612-018-9415-x","2018-10-08 18:15:51","25","Critical Criminology"

                  <p>This paper looks at the mechanisms through which financial corruption thrives both in Canadian society and elsewhere. There is a significant literature that examines the embeddedness of capitalism and the biases and advantages that this provides to all profit-directed activities. My focus is more on the social and attitudinal ways in which the embeddedness is exploited and simultaneously denied while serving as a lifestyle of the financially advantaged. I am interested in these cultures that develop and how the people within them come to accept their impunity and their entitlements as normal or at least &lsquo;business as usual&rsquo;. In addition, I am interested in the resistance to change pertaining to corruption of the powerful segments of our society. I present case studies that expose not only the privileges and advantages that capital allocates to the wealthiest but also a picture of the national and international social interactions among the clients, the enablers, and the regulators whereby the access to privilege is legitimized.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10612-018-9413-z","2018-10-08 19:30:36","27","Critical Criminology"
"12687","The Profits of Recognition: A Praxeological Approach to Corporate Crime","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>This paper offers a methodological intervention into the study and understanding of regulation and compliance with respect to corporate crime. We advocate Pierre Bourdieu&rsquo;s &ldquo;praxeological&rdquo; sociology as the bases for what we hold is an innovative model of regulation and compliance. The praxeological or relational approach offers structural analyses that take seriously the constructivist fixation with meaning, subjectivity, and perception without succumbing to the limitations of an interactionist conception of power. We first show theoretical affinities between the work of Pierre Bourdieu and Louis Althusser in order to highlight their shared concern with subject formation and their respective conceptions of &ldquo;mis/recognition&rdquo;. As this provides us with the theoretical basis of a more robust theory of regulation and compliance than is commonly found within the corporate crime literature, we argue that studies of corporate wrongdoing would benefit from rethinking the conceptions of compliance that currently shape corporate crime scholarship. We then demonstrate the benefits of this praxeological approach to regulation and compliance through discussion of the state&rsquo;s efforts to discipline corporations through criminal law in Canada and the United Kingdom.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10612-018-9417-8","2018-10-08 19:30:36","28","Critical Criminology"

                  <p>This paper critically examines the Canadian government&rsquo;s response to violent conflict at Canadian-owned extractive sites in Guatemala. Considering the trans/national-local context of a Canadian-U.S. owned silver mine in southeastern Guatemala, I piece together both the formal/overt and informal/banal ways that the Canadian government reneges on transparency related to government practice. To do this, I carry out a critical reading of hundreds of pages from Access to Information requests and email correspondence from Global Affairs Canada (GAC) and explore how Canada relates to and interacts with a Canadian mining company before, during and after a violent shooting at its Guatemalan project site. I argue that the Canadian embassy, and GAC&rsquo;s regular communication and contact with Tahoe Resources and its subsidiary, Minera San Rafael, under the guise of &lsquo;diplomatic relations&rsquo;&mdash;and charity events&mdash;points to a particular form of state-corporate symbiosis which seems to ignore vital socio-political and historical context.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10612-018-9422-y","2018-10-09 07:30:51","28","Critical Criminology"
"12689","Religious Involvement, Moral Community and Social Ecology: New Considerations in the Study of Religion and Reentry","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Objectives</h3>
                    <p>To examine the link between an individual&rsquo;s religious involvement in prison and recidivism and assess how macro-level conditions in the counties to which individuals return shape this relationship.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>Using data from 1362 previously incarcerated people, a series of hierarchical generalized linear models are used to examine the extent to which an individual&rsquo;s religious involvement in prison relates to recidivism post-release. We also examine how county-level religious adherence, economic disadvantage, and potential social service assistance directly affect recidivism, and how each shape the relationship between religious involvement and recidivism.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>Findings show that county-level religious adherence was directly associated with lower recidivism, but individual-level religious involvement was not when assessing recidivism over longer periods of time post-release. Cross-level interactions revealed that county-level resource deprivation conditions the effect of individual religious involvement.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>Findings have theoretical implications for the study of religion and reentry. Methodologically, failing to account for the religious context of counties, in addition to micro&ndash;macro linkages, harms individual level research on religion and reentry.</p>

                  <p>This article describes the almost total failure of legal systems to criminalize, regulate or restrict the crimes of capitalism and its institutions in the &ldquo;uber/gig&rdquo; economy. It examines how the technologically-enabled theft of time, space and wages from employees has been normalized and even celebrated. These unregulated excesses have exacerbated political, cultural and economic inequality and threatened or destroyed quality of life for millions. To understand why and how these harmful practices have attracted so little regulatory or criminal attention, the article examines how neoliberal capitalism, in its constant search for new ways to outsource costs and maximize profits, intersects with the democratic state and its professed obligation to prevent capital from &ldquo;going too far&rdquo; at the expense of citizens of that state.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10612-018-9416-9","2018-10-10 10:30:41","44","Critical Criminology"

                  <p>Prior studies of the sexual assault of women suggest the importance of weapon use, victim/offender familiarity, and offender intoxication as factors that contribute to offense severity in the form of victim injury. This body of literature is, however, inconsistent and limited insofar as it relies heavily on micro-level analysis of geographically limited samples of survivors and offenders. This study contributes to the literature through application of Agnew&rsquo;s General Strain Theory and race-specific hierarchical generalized linear modeling to incident-level data from the National Incident-Based Reporting System in conjunction with contextual-level data from cities in which the incidents are nested. Our findings suggest weapon use, victim-offender familiarity, and offender intoxication each contribute to offense severity, but these relationships are conditioned by strain-inducing community characteristics.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12103-018-9455-5","2018-10-10 11:15:07","25","American Journal of Criminal Justice"

                  <p>Since the rise of &ldquo;homeland security policing&rdquo; (Oliver <em>International Review of Law, Computers &amp; Technology, 20</em>(1-2), 49&ndash;62, <span>2006</span>), police agencies from all levels of organization are called on to cooperate by sharing intelligence, equipment, tactics, and training. While the increased level of cooperation between local policing agencies and Federal-level agencies has been well documented, far less attention has been paid to cooperation among agencies that share contiguous jurisdictions. Similarly, a body of research assesses if information is shared across agencies, but far less research exists that investigates if agencies cooperate in ways other than simply sharing information. Through interviews with officers from agencies operating in several adjacent jurisdictions, this research documents the ways in which agencies cooperate, the perceived benefits of cooperation, and the perceived challenges to cooperation. These findings suggest that agencies engage a variety of joint activities, and they agree on the benefits that working together affords. However, the broader political and contextual climates in which these organizations operate often limit the extent to which they can cooperate. Implications of this research for police management are discussed.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12103-018-9456-4","2018-10-16 20:30:08","59","American Journal of Criminal Justice"

                  <p>Mothers who experience intimate partner violence (IPV) are at increased risk for experiencing workplace instability in the form of absence from paid employment and job loss. In a cross-sectional study, we investigate if experiences of IPV inhibit work stability among low-income women as well as if the receipt of child care subsidies has a moderating effect on the relationship. Using data from the Illinois Families Study, we tested the relationships between IPV, work outcomes, and recipient of child care subsidies in a series of multivariate regressions. Findings indicate IPV is associated with reduced hours worked among low-income mothers and increased unemployment among low-income mothers. However, both of these relationships are moderated by receipt of child care subsidies suggesting that mothers who experience IPV can maintain employment at the same level as women not experiencing IPV with receipt of child care subsidies. Our findings indicate the importance of receiving child care subsidies among low-income mothers and support subsidy accessibility to survivors of IPV. Results of our study are limited in regard to the age of the data, the cross-sectional use of the data, and the lack of a control group that was not receiving any type of government assistance.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-0009-x","2018-10-17 05:16:10","26","Journal of Family Violence"

In addition to historical archival data to build a qualitative case study, it uses arrest warrant data (an emergency wiretap application and a Racketeering Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act or RICO indictment) from the FSO drug network investigation in order to visualize the structure of the cross border network and to explore research questions regarding the relationship between actor centrality/network topography metrics and variables of interest including organizational role, age, gender, number of prior arrests, location of criminal activity, and location of residence using social network analysis (SNA). Findings included: narcotics distributors, drug couriers, and enforcers for the network all had higher centrality in the network, age was only slightly negatively correlated with eigenvector centrality, gender had no bearing on centrality, the number of prior arrests also had no bearing on degree or betweenness centrality, but did positively correlate with eigenvector centrality. Findings also demonstrated faction subgroup analysis had considerable overlap with both law-enforcement-reported-address and location of criminal activity (coded as actor attributes). This finding suggests it may be possible to predict the location of criminal activity and residence through faction analysis in other binational trafficking networks.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12117-018-9352-9","2018-10-17 07:16:55","46","Trends in Organized Crime"

"12811","Police Discretion in Rape Cases","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>Although policing requires officers to follow policy guidelines when making decisions, these nevertheless leave room for discretion. We used a within-subjects experimental design and idiographic statistical analyses to examine the factors predicting 25 specialist police officers<span>&rsquo;</span> decisions to progress rape cases. We found little to no evidence of the influence of some factors (i.e., victim<span>&rsquo;</span>s criminal history, victim-suspect relationship, time taken to report crime, victim<span>&rsquo;</span>s prior reports of rape, victim<span>&rsquo;</span>s alcohol/drug use during offense, and suspect<span>&rsquo;</span>s previous convict<span>i</span>ons) on officers<span>&rsquo;</span> rape case progression decisions<span>.</span> However, 15 officers were less likely to progress cases involving victims who provided inconsistent accounts. Thus, some types of rape victims may not get access to the justice that they desire and deserve. Although officers also reported that consistency of the victim&rsquo;s account was important to their decision-making, there was generally a lack of concordance between officers&rsquo; self-reported and applied decision-making policies. Thus, officers&rsquo; accounts of how they progressed a rape case may be unreliable and invalid.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9299-4","2018-10-18 07:16:43","68","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"

"12816","Lifelong Wellbeing For Survivors of Sex Trafficking:  Collaborative Perspectives From Survivors, Researchers, and Service Providers","<p>This article summarizes a collaborative effort by researchers, service providers, and women who have experienced exploitation and trafficking for sex, to inform policy and practice related to care for survivors. The effort brought together current research program experience from around the world, and survivor perspectives, in a 2015 interactive forum entitled &ldquo;STREETS of Hope: Listening to and Supporting Survivors of Human Trafficking.&rdquo; A participatory approach to defining wellbeing, designed especially for use with vulnerable or highly marginalized populations of women and girls, provided the framework for the discussions. In addition, attempts were made to use principles of trauma-informed care during the workshop itself, toward the overall goals of 1) working as equals to inform research agendas; 2) gaining insights from survivors to improve services; and 3) providing survivors and all participants with a wellbeing model that can help them think and speak with specificity and clarity about their personal growth, wellbeing, and self-care. The results of the interactive two-day workshop and subsequent consultations included: 1) increased understandings and more detailed descriptions of what wellbeing is from the lived experience of survivors, and 2) insights about ways that services and care can be more responsive to the needs and preferences of survivors. Further, the collective exercise suggested revisions and specifications to the wellbeing model itself. Finally, the collaborators identified future directions for their shared research and practice. Overall, the experience of the &ldquo;STREETS of Hope Forum&rdquo; supports the idea that iterative, equitable, collaborative work with survivors must be employed to inform systems of care, and that a dynamic and multi-dimensional concept of wellbeing can help survivors, researchers, program leaders and policy-makers to foster support and agency throughout the life course. For those who participated, &ldquo;STREETS of Hope&rdquo; constituted a reframing of the goals of services care. It enabled us to think beyond basic needs and survival as defined by caregivers, to one that centers the experience of survivors and fosters recognition of and realization of their talents and life aspirations.</p>","https://digitalcommons.uri.edu/dignity/vol3/iss3/3","2018-10-18 15:45:42","22","Dignity: A Journal on Sexual Exploitation and Violence"

"12821","(s)expectations Abroad: Male Traveler Interactions With Southeast Asian Economies","<p>Interacting with locals is a highlight of the tourism experience; however, these interactions may be accompanied by unsolicited propositions for the traveler to participate in the sex industry. Through the lens of Thailand&rsquo;s largely visible sex industry, this work addresses issues of tourism and travel intertwined with the sex industry in greater Southeast Asia. Governments, a variety of businesses and individuals benefiting financially from a burgeoning sex tourism industry encourage persistence of a viable local sex trade. Although subtleties exist between human trafficking, the sex industry, and sex tourism, each can be intertwined. This article provides an overview of the Southeast Asian sex industry followed by my (Elliot Glotfelty) personal experience witnessing child sex trafficking during an otherwise normal tourist excursion in Vientiane, Laos. During the drive back from the early evening trip, my driver offered to join me for a beer and made stops at a karaoke bar and beer shop, which turned out to be thinly veiled brothels. Having worked on human trafficking research in Thailand during the prior months, I recognized the situation into which I had stumbled. I was soon encouraged to purchase sex from multiple women and girls and therefore given an unexpected insight into local interaction with sex establishments. I was clear that I did not want to partake/buy anyone and extracted myself as soon as possible to get back to my guesthouse. My driver entered these spaces and seemed to know some of the girls inside and treated the situation with casualness. Local buyers of sex, such as my driver, are largely responsible for perpetuation of sex economies, though tourists have historically driven and remain important sources of income for many individuals, including businesses not directly associated with the sex industry. The goal of this article is to bring more awareness to child/human sexual exploitation and how tourists, specifically men, interact with the economies where it is prevalent. Focus on male buyers of sex throughout this piece is not intended to imply that women do not buy sex or engage in sex tourism. Recommendations for ethical tourism practices and possible policy interventions are provided at the end of the article.</p>","https://digitalcommons.uri.edu/dignity/vol3/iss3/4","2018-10-18 20:15:45","34","Dignity: A Journal on Sexual Exploitation and Violence"

In doing so, the purpose of this paper is to shed new light on the democratising process in the habitus of policing.   Design/methodology/approach This study presents a novel data set that evaluates the introduction of BWC to police officers in the East Midlands area of England. The authors conducted an extensive survey to explore the perceptions of 162 police officers about the BWCs. The authors examined the empirical data using Stata within the theoretical framework of Pierre Bourdieu concerning the concept of habitus.   Findings The authors have found that most police officers perceive that BWCs have a positive impact on policing practices and evidence collection. The positive perceptions and evidence-focussed perceptions increase the importance of BWCs; however, there are also negative perceptions regarding effective policing, administrative functionality and establishing a better relationship with the community. The authors argued that all three areas: positive perceptions, negative perceptions and evidence-focussed perceptions play a stimulating role to democratise the habitus of policing. On the other hand, BWCs do not guarantee the consolidation of democratic principles in the habitus of policing because of the authority of police to decide when, where and how to use BWCs.   Research limitations/implications The research is limited to the perceptions of 162 police officers in East Midlands before they actually started using it. A future study to analyse their real-life experiences after using the BWCs may help us to compare their perceptions before using it with real-life experiences after BWCs are used. In addition, a comparative approach between countries in future research will help to explain the role of technological applications in different social geographies and legal systems.   Originality/value This study offers new insights about the perceptions of police on BWCs before they started using them. The authors introduce the democratic habitus of policing as an innovative concept and explored power dynamics in the habitus of policing through BWCs. The findings provide a strong empirical contribution to determine the conditions of democratic habitus of policing. In doing so, this study develops our theoretical knowledge about the habitus concept in sociology by employing BWCs in policing activities.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/SC-03-2018-0008?af=R","2018-10-19 12:32:41","34","Safer Communities"

Design/methodology/approach In total, 512 students completed a student lifestyle survey.   Findings A differentiated normalisation is occurring amongst different student groups; the social supply of drugs is common, and some users are â€œdriftingâ€ into supply roles yet such acts are neutralised. Students are â€œdrug literateâ€ and have to navigate drugs, and their consumption, availability and marketing, as part of their everyday student life.   Practical implications Student drug use is not homogenous and very little is known about the nuances and diversity of their use/non-use beyond prevalence data. Qualitative studies are needed to better understand the processes of differentiated normalisation and social supply.   Originality/value This is the first study in the UK to use the six dimensions of normalisation amongst a sample of university students.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/SC-01-2018-0002?af=R","2018-10-19 12:32:41","33","Safer Communities"

Design/methodology/approach The paper argues that there is a need for a fundamental shift in the way care and intervention for young people within the secure estate is delivered. It gives an overview of current challenges and needs and summarises the theoretical concepts and evidence base which can guide practice and form the foundations of the SS framework.   Findings The framework recommends that intervention shift from focussing primarily on individual assessment and treatment to a greater emphasis on supporting the work of the wider system of care. Recommendations include promoting trauma-informed care, a focus on the system dynamics within institutions and how these impact on the care young people receive, and on the collaborative development with residential staff and young people of formulation-led care plans that include a focus on issues of sustainability after leaving the secure estate.   Practical implications These include the establishment of discrete residential groupings with truly integrated and trauma-informed work across residential, mental health, education and criminal justice agencies. This involves addressing governance issues around shared record keeping, and challenges to sustainability and the accompanying need for local implementation plans for each establishment alongside central support at a strategic level.   Originality/value This paper describes a new and innovative way of working within secure settings to ensure children and young peopleâ€™s needs are better met.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/SC-07-2018-0019?af=R","2018-10-19 12:32:41","27","Safer Communities"
"12828","Business Crime Reduction Partnerships: Examining A Holistic Approach","Safer Communities, Volume 17, Issue 4, Page 238-248, October 2018. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose There has been a widespread move in Englandâ€™s city centres to a business crime reduction partnership (BCRP) model that welcomes businesses from all commercial sectors and that operate during day time and night time trading hours, and that seeks to tackle a broad range of crimes and associated behaviours. The purpose of this paper is to consider whether this new holistic approach offers benefits that narrower models do not.   Design/methodology/approach This study draws upon data from a multi-year examination of the Gloucester City Safe BCRP, including quantitative analysis of 4,523 offences recorded by the partnership and qualitative analysis of 149 interviews with its members.   Findings In Gloucester there was a small minority of offenders who commit offences against more than one type of business, who offend during both the day time and night time trading hours and who commit more than one type of offence. There is value, therefore, in partnerships bringing together businesses from different commercial sectors and that operate in the day and night time economies to coordinate their efforts to tackle such activity.   Practical implications Sharing information among partnership members via e-mail and secure web-based platforms helps raise awareness concerning offenders and the offences that they commit which in turn can be used to prevent offences from occurring.   Social implications This inclusive holistic BCRP model can lead to an increased sense of community cohesion for its members arising from the collective effort of multiple types of businesses.   Originality/value The authors are not aware of other studies that have considered these issues.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/SC-07-2018-0020?af=R","2018-10-19 12:32:41","37","Safer Communities"
"12829","Guardians of the Hallways? School Resource Officers and Bullying","Safer Communities, Volume 17, Issue 4, Page 202-212, October 2018. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose School resource officers (SROs) have become commonplace in schools across the USA. Although their visibility may allow them to function as capable guardians, little research has examined their impact on less serious but more common forms of school violence, like bullying. The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between the presence, quantity and roles of SROs and the frequency of bullying.   Design/methodology/approach Data come from the nationally representative 2006 School Survey on Crime and Safety. The relationship between SROs and bullying, controlling for other guardians, motivated offenders and school characteristics, was assessed using ordered logistic regression. Separate models were estimated for middle and high schools.   Findings There was no association between the presence, quantity or role of SROs and bullying in middle or high schools; however, teacher training was associated with less frequent bullying, especially in middle schools, and the presence of motivated offenders was associated with more frequent bullying.   Research limitations/implications Whether SROs reduce school violence is contested; this study found no association between SROs and bullying, a less serious but more common form of school violence. Future research should consider the roles of SROs in schools and the credibility of capable guardians.   Practical implications The results caution against continuing to divert educational and social service resources to law enforcement in schools. Continued training for teachers may provide more effective guardianship against bullying.   Originality/value This paper contributes to the developing literature on the effect of SROs on less serious but more common forms of school violence, like bullying.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/SC-06-2018-0018?af=R","2018-10-19 12:32:41","32","Safer Communities"

"12873","Patrol Career Interest and Perceptions of Barriers Among African-American Criminal Justice Students","Policing: An International Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose The purpose of this paper is to evaluate whether black and African-American criminal justice students perceive barriers to a police patrol career differently than white students, and whether the perceptions of these barriers impact desire to enter a police patrol career.   Design/methodology/approach The current inquiry uses a self-administered survey of over 630 undergraduate students in criminal justice classes across five public universities.   Findings Findings suggest that African-American students differ significantly from white students in perceived social disapproval of patrol careers, respect for police and perceptions of whether the police engage in racial profiling. These perceptions display a significant indirect relationship indicating lower patrol career interest for black and African-American students compared to all other races.   Research limitations/implications Research limitations of the current inquiry include the lack of a nationally representative sample, the use of four-year university students as a sample to represent the potential police patrol applicant pool, and the use of a survey instrument to gauge respondent beliefs about patrol careers as opposed to actions they would take in pursuit of a police career.   Practical implications Findings from the current inquiry indicate that departments may need to focus more on improving global perceptions of the police and discussing the nature of the career with recruit social support structures. Police recruiters should focus on techniques such as addressing social isolation experienced by the police rather than on decreasing standards for background checks or simply increasing awareness of police careers.   Originality/value The current inquiry is one of the first to explore perceptions of barriers to entering a patrol career among CJ students. It is also among the first to examine the impact these perceptions have on patrol career interest. The findings may also help criminal justice instructors more fully discuss these barriers with students of color.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-06-2018-0078?af=R","2018-10-20 22:18:32","59","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

However, the Diffusion of Innovation Theory and the studies that have grown out of it have contributed to creation of a model that helps explain adoption rates of new technology by individuals working in an organization. To verify whether this model can be used to study the adoption of technology in police organizations, our study examines the factors that influence the adoption of social media (SM) by members (<span>n</span> = 177) of Quebec police organizations. Our findings confirm that the factors identified in the literature on innovation&mdash;the perception that potential users have of the new technology as well as organizational factors, such as the respondent&rsquo;s role in the organization&mdash;can also help explain why and how frequently a member uses SM in his or her work.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay079/5140108?rss=1","2018-10-21 13:02:14","80","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"

                  <span>
                    <h3>Purpose</h3>
                    <p>This study aimed to explore whether and how sibling delinquency affects adolescent delinquency, over and beyond the effects of other social domains such as parents, school, and peers, and whether this sibling effect is time-varying over the course of adolescence.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>Six waves of data from the &ldquo;Research on Adolescents Development And Relationships-Younger cohort&rdquo; (RADAR-Y) were analyzed using hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) techniques. Besides an overall model, separate models were tested for the periods of early and late adolescence respectively, in which we accounted for differences in sibling pair composition with regard to gender and age.</p>

                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>Sibling&rsquo;s delinquency was shown to be positively related to adolescent delinquency in early adolescence, only for sister and mixed-sex sibling pairs, but these effects disappeared in later adolescence. In brother pairs, an opposite pattern was observed: sibling delinquency was not related to delinquent behavior in early adolescence, whereas it was in late adolescence.</p>

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>Sibling&rsquo;s delinquency explains part of adolescents&rsquo; delinquency in early adolescence, beyond the influence exerted by peers, parents, and school. Analyzing early and late adolescence in separate models provided a more detailed insight in the influence of sibling&rsquo;s delinquency over time, and controlling for sex composition reveals that development of sibling similarity in delinquency differs between brothers, sisters, and mixed-sex sibling pairs.</p>

                  <p>This article investigates the effect of police prevention visits to recently burgled households on revictimization risk, using data on 8984 burgled houses in Adelaide, South Australia. We compare burgled dwellings whose inhabitants got advice with burgled dwellings whose inhabitants did not accept the offer of a prevention visit, and with burgled dwellings that did not get an offer at all. Using survival analysis, we estimate the effect size of the impact of prevention visits on revictimization risk. More than one in five cases of revictimization has been prevented through the prevention visit scheme.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1057/s41300-018-0055-6","2018-10-23 09:15:45","47","Crime Prevention and Community Safety"

                  <p>Environmental Criminology has developed a robust framework that provides the scientific support and necessary foundation for crime analysis through crime mapping. This theoretical approach focuses on the situational and temporal characteristics of criminal opportunity rather than on the offender&rsquo;s behavior for crime prevention. In the scope of road safety and traffic crashes, few studies have adopted this approach. This study used risk terrain modeling (RTM), developed by the Rutgers Center on Public Security, to determine the relative importance of varying environmental risk factors on alcohol-related crashes and traffic accidents. The independent variables consisted of a set of potential environmental risk factors, while the dependent variable comprised all DWI crashes and traffic accidents in the province of C&aacute;diz in 2012. According to the results of the current study, restaurant locations are spatially associated with the occurrence of drunk driving crashes, while proximity restaurants and recreational lodging centers correlate with the sites of traffic accidents.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10610-018-9398-x","2018-10-24 12:16:36","60","European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research"

"13051","Crime in the Age of Technology","<p dir=""LTR"" align=""JUSTIFY"">The serious and organised crime landscape in the EU has changed drastically in the past years - in large part due to advancements in technology. Criminals quickly adopt and integrate new technologies into their modi operandi or build brand-new business models around them. The use of new technologies by organised crime groups (OCGs) has an impact on criminal activities across the spectrum of serious and organised crime. This includes developments online, such as the expansion of online trade and widespread availability of encrypted communication channels, as well as other aspects of technological innovation such as more accessible and cheaper drone technology, automated logistics, and advanced printing technologies. Technology has become a key component of most, if not all, criminal activities carried out by OCGs in the EU and has afforded organised crime with an unprecedented degree of flexibility. The vital role of technology for organised crime is reflected in the data collected and analysed for the SOCTA 2017 presented by Europol in March 2017. Also the Internet Organised Crime Threat Assessment (iOCTA) issued by Europol in September provides updated findings regarding the misuse of technologies and the internet by criminals. What can the EU&rsquo;s law enforcement community do to tackle the new challenges of crime in the age of technology?</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>","https://bulletin.cepol.europa.eu/index.php/bulletin/article/view/337","2018-10-24 14:16:56","61","European Law Enforcement Research Bulletin"
"13052","Maximising the Security and Safety of Citizens By Strengthening the Connection Between the Police and the Communities They Serve.","<p>This paper provides a discussion on the objectives, approach and findings of the EU H2020 funded UNITY project. The project aims to strengthen the connection between the police and the communities they serve by providing a suite of ICT tools to improve collaboration, cooperation and information sharing between LEAs (Law Enforcement Agencies) and the communities they serve. The paper defines the underlying concept of community policing, before moving into a discussion about the developed ICTs and the empirical research underpinning their development and the subsequent approach used to test them. Within, we build upon the theoretical notion that ICTs in isolation do little to break down existing cultural, socio-economic and other embedded factors that contribute to absences in collaboration between citizen groups and the police. Instead, ICTs are an important mechanism at can be used to reinforce existing cultures of collaboration and trust, providing an additional vector through which citizens can make a contribution in their local communities, and through which police can be made contextually aware of local crime issues.</p>","https://bulletin.cepol.europa.eu/index.php/bulletin/article/view/334","2018-10-24 14:16:56","34","European Law Enforcement Research Bulletin"

                  <p>The so-called Nordic model to respond to prostitution has been considered in legislative debates across Europe and internationally, and hailed by some as best practice to tackle sex trafficking and is believed to support gender equality. Yet, when we interrogate the utilisation of the Nordic countries laws by law enforcers, it is not being implemented as per the law. We argue that &lsquo;all that is occurring is the transfer of rhetoric and ideology&rsquo; in these countries ((Stone Politics, 19 (1): 51&ndash;59, <span>1999</span>) at 56). In this article, we expose the cracks in the so-called Nordic model, thereby discrediting the &lsquo;persuasive&rsquo; nature of a unified Nordic approach to prostitution. We draw on policy transfer and comparative law literature to illuminate the problems and challenges of na&iuml;ve adoption of this so-called model, arguing that this can lead to uninformed, inappropriate and incomplete transfer of the Nordic model, which then becomes a policy irritant, further exacerbating the very problems it seeks to address.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10611-018-9795-6","2018-10-25 04:16:14","46","Crime, Law and Social Change"

                  <p>This paper examines the social ecology of gang activity in Fort Worth, Texas, a community with decades-long and recent growth in Latino immigrant populations. Focusing on the contextual correlates of police-defined gang incidents, the paper explores the relationship between traditional social ecological measures of concentrated disadvantage, residential stability, Latino immigration and racial composition and police-defined gang crime activity in Fort Worth communities. To better understand the social ecological dynamics that correlate with gang activity, the analysis uniquely disaggregates gang activity using 1) the police department&rsquo;s gang-related classification system and, 2) four categories of gang crime behaviors within police classifications. Overall, the findings reveal that traditional social ecological indicators are significantly related to gang activity; however, the relationship collapses with disaggregation by gang-involved and gang-related crime behaviors and the four disaggregated crime classifications. Implications for research, theory, and policy are discussed.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10611-018-9798-3","2018-10-25 07:16:16","42","Crime, Law and Social Change"

                    <h3>Objectives</h3>
                    <p>In criminal cases, prosecutors treat defendant-authored rap lyrics as an admission of guilt rather than as art or entertainment. Do negative stereotypes about rap music shape jurors&rsquo; attitudes about the defendant, unfairly influencing outcomes? Replicating and extending previous research (Fischoff <em>Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 29</em>(4), 795&ndash;805, <span>1999</span>; Fried <em>Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 26</em>(23), 2135&ndash;2146, <span>1996</span>; Dunbar et al. <em>Public Policy, and Law, 22</em>(3), 280&ndash;292, <span>2016</span>), the current study begins to address these questions.</p>

                    <p>Using an experimental approach, participants were presented with music lyrics and asked to make judgments about the person who wrote the lyrics. All participants read the same lyrics but were told they were from a country, heavy metal, or rap song, depending upon the condition into which they were randomly assigned. Again using random assignment, participants were provided with information about the race of the songwriter in a photo of a young man. Finally, participants were tasked with judging the character of the songwriter, including traits such as his violent nature and criminal disposition.</p>

                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>We find that writers of violent &ldquo;rap&rdquo; lyrics are perceived more negatively than writers who pen identical country and heavy metal lyrics. We also find that songwriter race matters; no differences in judgments were detected between the White and Black songwriters; however, when race information was not provided, participants who inferred the songwriter was Black judged him more negatively than participants who inferred he was White.</p>

                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>Using participant data (<em>N</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;307) from the Police Officer Perception Project (Simpson <span>2017</span>), I experimentally assess the effects of police vehicles on perceptions of police officers.

                    <p>Police officers are perceived differently when occupying different types and colors of police vehicles.

"13065","Body-Worn Cameras in the Post-Ferguson Era: An Exploration of Law Enforcement Perspectives","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>In the aftermath of Michael Brown&rsquo;s death in Ferguson, Missouri, confidence in police has weakened. Body-worn cameras (BWCs) are perceived to increase law enforcement transparency and accountability, and, by proxy, restore law enforcement legitimacy. Though the empirical status of BWCs has grown in recent years, missing from these accounts are the actual words and narratives of officers. Through a qualitative approach, the data and analysis within this paper overcome this issue and indicate that BWCs have had an impact on police&ndash;citizen interactions in one Southern American State. More specifically, citizen and officer accountability from BWCs was found to have positive and negative consequence. Officers articulated this supposition in a number of ways and the paper contextualizes these perspectives within the extant literature. The policy implications and areas of future research from these findings are discussed as they inform a non-positivist approach to research.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9300-2","2018-10-25 11:17:36","39","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"

                  <p>Research suggests that personal and situational characteristics influence how and when residents provide guardianship over where they live (Reynald in J Res Crime Delinq 47(3): 358&ndash;390, <span>2010</span>). However, there is limited empirical scholarship regarding what motivates residents to act as guardians and control crime in different contexts. The current study explores the role motivation and opportunity play in facilitating monitoring and intervention among potential guardians against crime in suburban Australia. Twenty semi-structured interviews with Brisbane suburban residents were conducted and suggested the existence of four typologies of suburban guardians: active, opportunistic, responsive, and non-guardians. Factors crucial to facilitating monitoring include the physical design of houses, relationships with neighbours, prior victimisation, and daily routine activities. Direct intervention is supported by feelings of responsibility and capability. Other themes found to support guardianship decision-making were also identified, and results suggest that residents supervise and monitor their street regardless of current crime rates. Implications for theory and practice, and directions for future research, are discussed.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1057/s41300-018-0057-4","2018-10-25 12:31:23","25","Crime Prevention and Community Safety"

This research determined that guardianship intensity at the property level can be measured through direct observation, and the measurement of guardianship intensity is enhanced when measures of aspects of the physical and social environment are included. Guardianship in action has been examined previously in major metropolitan areas and suburban contexts. Research has not examined the utility of the guardianship in action instrument or the related guardianship construct in rural areas, small cities and towns, or smaller non-metropolitan cities. The current study is designed to examine guardianship in action in a smaller, non-metropolitan city&mdash;Waco, Texas.

                  <p>Military veteran status has been associated with a variety of criminal justice outcomes as well as higher rates of mental illness and suicide when compared to the general population. Although research has generally focused on why veterans become involved with the justice system, less is known about their experiences while incarcerated. In particular, studies of veterans in the community context indicate that they are unwilling to seek out mental health treatment due to potential stigmas, suggesting that this reluctance may extend into the prison environment. Using a sample of 14,278 veteran and nonveteran inmates, we find that veterans do not necessarily fare worse in prison and are actually more likely to obtain treatment. However, this effect is largely mediated by the greater history of mental disorders and suicidal behaviors among veterans. Our findings lend credence to recent efforts designed to screen and manage justice-involved veterans as a distinct, at-risk group.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12103-018-9458-2","2018-10-25 14:15:59","19","American Journal of Criminal Justice"

The world has never changed as much as it has in the last decades, which means that the roles of police organizations in today&rsquo;s societies are also changing rapidly. Police organizations face more challenging and more complex problems in more diverse societies. As a result, the police manager&rsquo;s work has become more demanding. The importance of leadership to the performance of the organization has been demonstrated in various studies. Police organizations need managers who are professionals in both management and leadership. Finland's Police University College has developed a new and original management training program &ndash; the EMBA in Policing &ndash; in cooperation with Tampere University of Technology. This innovative police management training program is based on Quinn's Model of Leadership. The idea of this paper is to introduce the EMBA in Policing program as a new way to train future police leaders and to research how Quinn&rsquo;s model serves as a theoretical framework in police management and leadership training. In this article, the author describes the model of the EMBA in Policing program, and reports the results of the pilot training.</p>","https://bulletin.cepol.europa.eu/index.php/bulletin/article/view/358","2018-10-25 15:16:43","49","European Law Enforcement Research Bulletin"

                  <p>Researchers have been interested in police investigations for a half-century or more. In the academic literature, however, there is virtually no examination of analogous investigation units and investigators that operate exclusively in jails, prisons, or detention centers, despite these units being in nearly all large local, state, and federal facilities. The purpose of the present study was to bring one unit&rsquo;s operations to light. We conducted focus groups with current and former correctional investigators regarding the tempo of their work, the various natures of their investigations, and how the investigators viewed their place within broader criminal justice operations. A major component of the corrections-based operations includes investigative interviews of inmates for intelligence-gathering purposes, and we identified a process model of correctional investigations that may be applicable to the wider field of correctional intelligence units.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1057/s41284-018-0157-y","2018-10-26 11:19:33","45","Security Journal"

                  <p>Surveillance cameras have become a popular response to crime and disorder in urban parks. The literature regarding park surveillance cameras however is sparse and few have examined the impact of park surveillance cameras. This research study examined a five camera police department network in a southern US municipal park. The study measured pre- and post-camera effects on reported crime, calls for service, and park visitor perceptions. Analysis determined that although the surveillance cameras had minimal impact on crime or disorder they were related to park visitor perceptions of the park. A camera surveilled park was seen more positively following police camera installation even though perceptions of the effectiveness of surveillance cameras decreased.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1057/s41300-018-0058-3","2018-10-26 14:17:25","45","Crime Prevention and Community Safety"

"13099","Feeling Blue: Officer Perceptions of Public Antipathy Predict Police Occupational Norms","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>Recent protests against law enforcement have spurred claims by practitioners and editorialists that public antipathy toward the police may influence police occupational norms. A number of classic police ethnographies also suggest a link between perceived public antipathy and police culture, but limited empirical research has examined this claim. Using a sample of 12,376 sworn law enforcement officers who participated in the National Police Research Platform, and a series of ordinary least squares regressions, this study examines whether officers&rsquo; perceptions of public support predict their cultural orientations. Results reveal that officers perceiving greater public antipathy report higher levels of social isolation, work-group solidarity, cynicism toward the public, and coercive attitudes. We identify practical implications and potential organizational remedies to address these perceptions, and situate these findings within theoretical arguments of early police ethnographers and contemporary claims of the &ldquo;Ferguson Effect.&rdquo;&emsp;</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12103-018-9459-1","2018-10-27 06:17:09","84","American Journal of Criminal Justice"

                  <p>Canada&rsquo;s <em>Youth Criminal Justice Act</em> (<em>YCJA</em>) heralded many changes in the treatment of youth within the justice system, particularly in regard to holding youth &ldquo;accountable&rdquo; and the use of &ldquo;meaningful consequences.&rdquo; Under the former <em>Young Offenders Act</em> (<em>YOA</em>) far more youth were given custodial sentences, while under the <em>YCJA</em> youth custody rates have plummeted. Yet few scholars have empirically assessed how correctional officers working with youth (COs) interpret and experience &ldquo;accountability&rdquo; and &ldquo;meaningful consequences&rdquo; in their day-to-day work. Based on 24 in-depth interviews, we examine the most perceptible changes COs employed in Canadian youth closed-custody facilities encountered, as a result of the legislative movement from the <em>YOA</em> to the <em>YCJA.</em> Findings suggest that the criminality of sentenced youth has changed with the new legislation, as well as how COs do their job&mdash;some feeling that the legislation is at odds with their occupational responsibility and negatively impacting their ability to &ldquo;do the job&rdquo;. Recommendations for youth correctional practice are offered.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10611-018-9801-z","2018-10-27 08:17:20","34","Crime, Law and Social Change"

A Typology in the Making","<span><div>Abstract</div>The phenomenon of police corruption has received a significant share of attention by both scholars and practitioners. However, although notable knowledge has been built on a corpus of circumferential issues in and determinants of corruption, the array of coping strategies of police officers who encounter corrupt practices and interact with corrupt colleagues has evaded empirical analysis. That said, this article sets out to do that and draws on data collected from a web survey, based on a sample of 446 Cypriot police officers. In the main, it is argued that inertia and apathy are embedded in the preponderance of police officers&rsquo; attitudes towards their corrupt peers. Also, for delineating (and somewhat explicating) the coping strategies of police officers who share workplaces with corrupt peers, a typology based on the COPE Inventory is introduced.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay080/5145766?rss=1","2018-10-27 10:48:46","69","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"

A key challenge is to understand how best to impart relevant skills and knowledge about cybercrime throughout the organization to enable police officers to react appropriately to such incidents. This article is drawn from research undertaken as part of the CARI Project, a major study into the effectiveness of cybercrime investigation within a large UK police force funded by the Police Knowledge Fund. As part of the needs assessment for the above project, concerns were raised about the effectiveness of existing training arrangements in facilitating the development of cyber skills within police officers. The present research, based on survey data, explored the effectiveness of different training styles as perceived by those who had undertaken cyber training. The research found that officers perceived some modes of training as more effective than others and highlighted some of the organizational contexts that impact negatively on the delivery of effective cyber training. The findings are presented within a context, informed by existing literature, that acknowledges wider debates surrounding the pedagogy of police learning and the organizational challenges of developing cyber skills within police officers. The authors believe that the findings will have relevance to police training policy both in the UK and in the wider international context.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay078/5145767?rss=1","2018-10-27 10:48:46","93","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"

                  <p>Most money laundering (ML) risk assessments carried out in Europe and abroad are qualitative analyses at national aggregate level. To complement current knowledge, this paper &ndash; based on the findings of the European co-funded project IARM (Identifying and Assessing the Risk of Money laundering in Europe -<a href=""http://www.transcrime.it/iarm"">www.transcrime.it/iarm</a>) &ndash; proposes a new quantitative methodology to measure ML risk across regions in a country and tests it on the 110 Italian provinces. In particular, it develops a composite indicator of ML risk, which combines a variety of risk factors (classified as <em>threats</em> and <em>vulnerabilities</em>), such as organised crime, tax evasion, cash-intensiveness and opacity of business structure. The application of the methodology to Italy reveals that the areas with the highest (relative) ML risk are in the south of the country, in particular Calabria, with some exceptions in the centre (e.g. province of Prato) and in the north (e.g. Imperia). The developed risk indicator can support policy-makers and investigators in allocating anti-money laundering (AML) resources more effectively, but it can also be helpful for obliged entities such as banks and professionals to improve their &ldquo;risk based&rdquo; customer due diligence activities.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10610-018-9399-9","2018-10-27 11:18:01","42","European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research"

                  <p>This article seeks to develop an understanding of how corporations manage their social and ethical responsibilities, whilst simultaneously facing allegations of crime. It draws on the case of TeliaSonera, a Swedish corporation prosecuted for committing bribery in Uzbekistan. The article begins by introducing the reader to this so-called &lsquo;Uzbek affair&rsquo;, before exploring how corporate governance has shifted in the new regulatory landscape, and the role CSR plays in this landscape. Secondly, it critically deconstructs TeliaSonera&rsquo;s regulatory regime, in order to analyse how the risks of corruption and bribery are managed in the aftermath of the Uzbek affair, and what functions this management fulfils for the corporation&rsquo;s front stage performance. By drawing on the distinction between primary and secondary risk management as proposed by Power [<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>], the article argues that the regime in place to manage social and ethical risks simultaneously manages reputational and profitability-related risks, thus illustrating the dual functions of corporate risk management. This duality, it is suggested, is a consequence of the responsibilisation process in which corporations have become self-regulating entities, which allows for a &lsquo;risk management of everything&rsquo; (cf. [<span>1</span>]).</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10611-018-9799-2","2018-10-27 12:17:33","41","Crime, Law and Social Change"

                  <p>The Revised Conflict Tactics Scale 2 (CTS2; Straus et al. <em>Journal of Family Issues, 17</em>(3), 283&ndash;316, <span>1996</span>) is the most widely used measure for assessing the frequency of intimate partner violence (IPV). However, it has been criticized for not capturing the context in which IPV takes place. This study examined follow-up items to each CTS2 physical assault item asking to clarify how often the act was perpetrated in self-defense. A community sample of couples (<em>N</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;180) recruited for men&rsquo;s recent violence toward women completed the project-modified Conflict Tactics Scale with Self-Defense (CTS2SD). The majority (69.5%) reported that the physical aggression in the past year was bilateral. On the follow-up items, 27% of men&rsquo;s violent acts and over 22% of women&rsquo;s violent acts were reportedly committed in self-defense. Men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s CTS2 physical assault perpetration scores, along with the percentage that were committed in self-defense, were entered into two-step cluster analyses. Cluster analyses revealed three subgroups of bilateral violence: Male Self-defense, Female Self-defense, and Mutual Violence. The Mutual Violent cluster reported the most frequent physical assault, injury, men&rsquo;s controlling behavior and men&rsquo;s arrest for domestic violence. Findings suggest that Straus&rsquo; (<em>Behavioral Sciences and the Law, 30</em>(5), 538&ndash;556, <span>2012</span>) tripartite conceptualization of <em>Man</em>-<em>only</em>, <em>Woman</em>-<em>only</em>, and <em>Both</em>-<em>violent</em> couples is overly simplistic and fails to capture different types of bilateral aggression.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-0012-2","2018-10-27 16:18:06","38","Journal of Family Violence"
"13116","Abuse Or Be Abused: Traumatic Memory, Sex Inequality, and Millennium As A Socio-Literary Device","<p>This article applies the research of French psychiatrist Muriel Salmona to literary analysis of Stieg Larsson&rsquo;s protagonist, Lisbeth Salander, in the <em>Millennium</em> trilogy (<em>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</em>, 2008; <em>The Girl Who Played with Fire</em>, 2009; <em>The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet&rsquo;s Nest</em>, 2010). It suggests that Larsson&rsquo;s novels may be useful in raising awareness of childhood sexual abuse, through reading neglected signs linked to the neurology of traumatic memory. In the tradition of Nordic noir novels, hyperboles in Salander&rsquo;s sensationalized identity serve to magnify and bring to light a misunderstood social problem. The article draws mainly on Salmona&rsquo;s book, <em>Le Livre Noir Violences Sexuelles</em> (2013) which has been influential in France but has not yet reached the rest of the world. The ground-breaking implications of Salmona&rsquo;s work explaining traumatic memory and linking it to sex inequality are explored and used for literary analysis. This socio-literary approach treats literature as a laboratory for better understanding real-life problems. In this case, it is akin to the rising trend of narrative medicine including in literary criticism, particularly, critical discourse analysis. Salmona&rsquo;s theories and Larsson&rsquo;s fictional character share many features, suggesting Larsson, like many writers, was ahead of his time. Not bound by scientific constraints, novelists can forge ahead with how they perceive the current world, shaping it in turn through raising awareness in readers.</p>","https://digitalcommons.uri.edu/dignity/vol3/iss3/6","2018-10-27 22:02:42","31","Dignity: A Journal on Sexual Exploitation and Violence"

"13122","Predictive Policing: Is It Really An Innovation?","<p><strong>Predictive policing: Is it really an innovation?</strong></p> <p>The novelty of predictive policing, its goals and promises, are put under criticism and discussion. In the last few years predictive policing have been presented as a new model for law enforcement activities. Predictive policing is based on the special skills of statisticians and computational scientists who run sophisticated techniques to analyse data available in disparate sources, to anticipate and prevent crime and disorder. Hence, a shift in the police work could be envisaged; a change of &lsquo;paradigm&rsquo; (T. Kuhn). This &ldquo;new&rdquo; model appears to be rooted in the last century 70s and 80s &lsquo;new penology&rsquo; with its actuarial approach, where numbers produce the individual. Further back in time, its roots can also be found in the 19th century vision of J. Bentham, when he proposed a &lsquo;moral arithmetic&rsquo; for the benefit of governmentality (M. Foucault). A predictive regime requires organisational capabilities and structures, a new way of thinking and (perhaps) new leaders. Police forces would have to be able to effectively make use of the findings of predictive research. Yet, some police forces still don&rsquo;t recognise the criticality of science and research. And, let&rsquo;s not forget that information <em>is not</em> knowledge, as it is &lsquo;indifferent&rsquo; to meaning and does not consider people&rsquo;s &lsquo;intentional states&rsquo; (J. Bruner). So, it seems the individual is lost in the mechanics of discovering patterns. But it takes only one to disrupt society...</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>","https://bulletin.cepol.europa.eu/index.php/bulletin/article/view/335","2018-10-29 10:34:20","98","European Law Enforcement Research Bulletin"

                  <p>Since the last decade, South Africa has been experiencing a number of economic crises because of corruption; white-collar crime and state capture allegations, which have been drivers for increased corporate governance. Attempts to harmonise risk management practices in organisations both nationally and internationally have been actualised in a number of risk management practices, the latest of which is ISO 31000. The risk management standard, ISO 31000, which was developed through contributions made by professionals worldwide, is anticipated to achieve the position as a global benchmark for risk management practices. The main aim of this study was to explore the use of the risk management standard ISO 31000 by private security companies in South Africa. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with security practitioners on the use of ISO 31000. The study found that security risk management maturity was lagging behind the standard.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1057/s41284-018-0158-x","2018-10-30 15:20:43","81","Security Journal"

                  <p>Intimate partner violence (IPV) is an important gender-based, social, and public health problem that affects women worldwide, including women who are pregnant or have recently given birth. Studies have shown that violence against women often increases during pregnancy and the postpartum period. This study aims to examine lifetime and past-year prevalence of IPV among postpartum women in Malaysia, and to determine the socio-demographic as well as husband&rsquo;s/partner&rsquo;s behavioral factors associated with IPV exposure. This is a nationwide, cross-sectional and clinic-based study involving a total of 5727 women at 6 to 16&nbsp;weeks postpartum, who attended randomly selected government health clinics between July to November 2016. Face-to-face interviews were conducted by trained female enumerators based on a pre-validated structured questionnaire, using mobile devices as data collection tools. Chi-squared tests and multivariable logistic regressions were used to investigate selected factors associated with IPV exposure. The lifetime and past-year prevalence of any form of IPV among postpartum women were 4.94% (95% CI [3.81,6.39]) and 2.42% (95% CI [1.74,3.35]) respectively, with the highest prevalence being emotional violence, followed by physical and sexual violence. Multivariable analysis showed that husband&rsquo;s/partner&rsquo;s behaviors, such as frequent alcohol use, drug use, fighting habits and controlling behaviour were significantly associated with both lifetime and past-year IPV (all <em>p</em>&thinsp;&lt;&thinsp;0.001 for past-year IPV). These findings suggest that prevention and intervention strategies for IPV should consider the prevention of substance use and reducing controlling behaviors by husband/partner, as well as raising awareness to build healthy relationships through education.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-0014-0","2018-10-31 08:19:07","58","Journal of Family Violence"

                  <p>Prostitution diversion program participants who have experienced lifelong patterns of abuse, including child polyvictimization and later adult victimization, may exhibit greater trauma symptomatology than participants who have not experienced lifelong abuse. If true, these participants may face unique barriers to successful program completion as a result of their increased trauma symptomatology. This calls into question whether incarceration is an appropriate sanction for program failure. Data from a prostitution diversion program located in Houston, Texas, was used to conduct a series of bivariate analyses that examined whether participants who had experienced multiple types of child abuse: (1) were more criminally involved, (2) were more likely to report adult victimization, and (3) exhibited greater trauma symptomatology relative to program participants who had never experienced child abuse, or only experienced a single type. Participants who had experienced multiple types of child abuse were more likely to report adult victimization and greater trauma symptomatology relative to participants who had not experienced any child abuse. The prostitution diversion program examined in this study contained a subgroup of participants who had experienced multiple types of child abuse, possessed an increased risk of adult victimization, and reported greater trauma symptomatology. These participants are trauma survivors, and may face unique barriers to program completion. Consequently, incarceration is a misguided sanction for program failure, as it may lead to further traumatization.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-0015-z","2018-10-31 14:19:05","51","Journal of Family Violence"

Design/methodology/approach Descriptive statistics explore both incident-level and hit rate shooting accuracy in single officer/single suspect shooting incidents in the Dallas Police Department between 2003 and 2017. Multiple regression models analyze the predictive utility of officer, suspect and situational factors on the two accuracy outcomes.   Findings Consistent with prior research, the results demonstrate that officers are often inaccurate in officer-involved shooting (OIS) incidents. Additionally, several factors emerged as significant predictors of shooting accuracy.   Practical implications The results are discussed in terms of the practical implications for training and accountability.   Originality/value It has been more than a decade since the last academic study investigated this important topic using actual OIS data. Acknowledging the general dearth of this literature, this study explores what factors contribute to shooting accuracy.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-05-2018-0060?af=R","2018-11-01 07:21:18","66","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

                  <span>
                    <h3>Objective</h3>
                    <p>To assess the effect of civil gang injunctions on crime.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>We use data on the location and date of 46 gang injunctions between 1993 and 2013 and quarterly crimes reported to the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) from 1988 to 2014. We estimate the effect of gang injunctions on crime over the short-term (20 quarters) and long-term (108 quarters) using difference-in-differences designs that take into account spatial and temporal correlation. Three gang injunctions were paused during the study period and provide a natural experiment from which we estimate the short-term effect of these injunctions on crime.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>Gang injunctions are estimated to reduce total crime 5% in the short-term and 18% in the long-term, most of the effect coming from reductions in assaults. Analyses of the three interrupted injunctions yielded estimates of similar magnitude, providing further support of a crime reduction effect of gang injunctions. We found no evidence that gang injunctions are associated with displacing crime to nearby areas.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>Injunctions represent a powerful place-based intervention strategy for police and prosecutors. Courts have recently subjected gang injunctions to closer scrutiny. This study indicates that gang injunctions contributed to a meaningful amount of the crime reductions in Los Angeles. Future research should examine whether gang injunctions reduce crime by specific deterrent effects on individual gang members or by the general deterrent effect of placing an area under greater police surveillance and restricting public gatherings and other actions deemed to be indicators of gang activity.</p>

                    <p>Four categories of events were tracked for each child: (1) <em>further witnessing of domestic abuse</em>, (2) a child being named as a <em>suspected offender</em> of a criminal offense, (3) a child being reported as a <em>victim</em> of a criminal offense, and (4) a child being reported as a <em>missing person</em> from the home.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Findings</h3>
                    <p>Further harmful events were highly prevalent (48%), yet over 92% of those events were repeated reports of witnessing domestic abuse. Less than 3% of the cohort went on to become a victim of crime, 1.6% were reported missing, and 6% were named as offenders in a crime over the 3&nbsp;years. Total events including new witnessing of DA were heavily concentrated in a &ldquo;power few&rdquo;: under 10% were reported in 50% of the 8685 subsequent events over the next 3&nbsp;years.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>Tracking subsequent harm to children present at domestic abuse shows more than enough concentration of future events to justify selective targeting of resources for further efforts to protect these children, ideally by using advanced predictive analytics such as random forests modeling.</p>

                  <p>Over the past decade, reports of cybercrime have soared across the globe. Criminologists agree that the increase in cybercrime stems from technological advancements that have changed all facets of societal interactions. While it is agreed that technology has shaped cybercrime, there is less understanding about the dynamics of cybercrime. In particular, some researchers have explored whether these offenses are simply traditional types of crime that are now carried out through different strategies, while others have argued that cybercrimes are, in fact, new types of crime. This ambiguity potentially limits prevention and intervention strategies. In an effort to build our understanding about cybercrime within a criminological framework, in this study we use labeling theory as a guide to examine the patterns, characteristics, and sanctions associated with a sample of cybercrimes with an aim towards identifying how these offenses are socially constructed in comparison to traditional crimes, white-collar crimes, and international crimes. In doing so, our hope is to further determine how cybercrime can be understood within current criminological thinking.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12103-018-9457-3","2018-11-03 05:19:01","43","American Journal of Criminal Justice"
"13185","Co-Producing Digitally-Enabled Courses That Promote Desistance in Prison and Probation Settings","Journal of Criminological Research, Policy and Practice, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose The purpose of this paper is to set out an approach to innovation in criminal justice settings that gives service users a â€œvoiceâ€ through the co-production of digital content designed for services that promote desistance. The authors describe the benefits and challenges of involving service users in co-creating mediated digital content within a co-production framework.   Design/methodology/approach This paper presents a new methodology for developing desistance-oriented programmes. The authors draw on a distinctive co-production exemplar within a prison setting that captures the perspectives of people who have shared their voices and the authors begin to explore the impact that co-production has had for them and for the service.   Findings The testimonies of service users involved in this exemplar provide insights into the benefits and challenges of co-production in the criminal justice system more broadly.   Practical implications Co-production is a credible service design strategy for developing digital services in prisons and probation; Complementary Digital Media (CDM) provides a promising pedagogical approach to promoting desistance; CDM enables service users to share their voice and stories to assist their peers. Digitally enabled courses to promote desistance can be well suited to peer support delivery models.   Originality/value CDM is a novel approach that uses co-production to create highly tailored content to promote desistance in discrete target groups. CDM can be used to digitalise processes within traditional offending behaviour programmes (OBPs). It can also enable the development of innovative toolkit approaches for flexible use within day-to-day therapeutic conversations between service users and criminal justice staff or peer supporters. CDM thereby offers practitioners in criminal justice settings an entirely new set of evidence-informed resources to engage service users.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JCRPP-07-2018-0023?af=R","2018-11-03 07:46:13","45","Journal of Criminological Research, Policy and Practice"
"13186","The Life in Custody Study: the Quality of Prison Life in Dutch Prison Regimes","Journal of Criminological Research, Policy and Practice, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose The Life in Custody (LIC) Study is a nationwide prospective cohort study examining the quality of prison life in the Netherlands. The purpose of this paper is to describe Dutch prisonersâ€™ perceptions of prison climate, as well as differences across regimes.   Design/methodology/approach The target population of the study consisted of all male and female adult prisoners in the Netherlands who were incarcerated in various regimes in a total of 28 prisons, between January and April 2017. An intensive and personal recruitment strategy was employed. Participants completed a detailed survey, the prison climate questionnaire (PCQ). Self-reported information on a variety of topics was collected, including perceived prison climate, well-being and self-reported behaviour.   Findings In total, 4,938 prisoners participated in the survey, which amounts to a high response rate of 81 per cent. Analyses show that respondentsâ€™ characteristics are almost identical to those of non-respondents. Ratings of prison climate vary across domains and regimes, with more positive scores for minimum-security regimes.   Practical implications A detailed methodological approach is described that can be adopted to achieve a high response rate with survey research among prisoners. The paper alerts researchers and practitioners to a large ongoing study and first findings on prison climate in the Netherlands. The PCQ can be requested from the authors and used in future research (internationally) to gain information about the perceived quality of prison life. The paper gives insight in how different regimes are associated with differences in perceived prison climate. Collaboration on the research project can be sought with the authors.   Originality/value Findings of the LIC study illustrate the value of having data on prison climate. Results of the study will contribute to more knowledge on imprisonment and what can be done to improve the humane treatment of offenders by the criminal justice system. Moreover, knowledge about the methodology of the study may enable future comparative research on prison climate.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JCRPP-07-2018-0020?af=R","2018-11-03 07:46:13","37","Journal of Criminological Research, Policy and Practice"
"13187","Ride to Die: Masculine Honour and Collective Identity in the Motorcycle Underworld","Journal of Criminological Research, Policy and Practice, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose The purpose of this paper is to discuss the nature and extent of violent practice in the motorcycle underworld. It does this by considering the murder of Gerry Tobin, and then uses the biography of the founding member of the Hellâ€™s Angels motorcycle club (HAMC) for a critical analysis. The authors are interested in understanding the role of masculine honour and collective identity, and its influences in relation to violence â€“ namely, fatal violence in the motorcycle underworld. The authors argue that motorcycle gangs are extreme examples of what Hall (2012) considers â€œcriminal undertakersâ€ â€“ individuals who take â€œspecial libertiesâ€ often as a last resort.   Design/methodology/approach The methodological approach seeks to analyse the paradigm of â€œmasculine honourâ€, and how the Outlaws MC (OMC) applied this notion when executing the seemingly senseless murder of Gerry Tobin. So too, the author triangulate these findings by critically analysing the biography of the founding member of the Californian chapter of the HAMC â€“ Sonny Barger. Further to this, a case study inevitably offers â€œconstraints and opportunitiesâ€ (Easton, 2010, p. 119). Through the process of triangulation, which is a method that utilises â€œmultiple sources of dataâ€, the researcher can be confident that the truth is being â€œconveyed as truthfully as possibleâ€ (Merriam, 1995, p. 54).   Findings What is clear within the OB worldview is that it can only be a male dominant ideology, with no allowance for female interference (Wolf, 2008). Thus, Messerschmidtâ€™s (1993) notion of â€œhegemonic masculinityâ€ fits the male dominated subcultures of the HAMC and OMC, which therefore provides the clubs with â€œexclusiveâ€ masculine identities (Wolf, 2008). For organisations like the HAMC, retaliation is perceived as an alternative form of criminal justice that is compulsory to undertake in order to defend their status of honour and masculinity.   Originality/value Based on our understanding, this is the first critical think piece that explores a UK case of homicide within the context of the motorcycle underworld. It also provides a comprehensive understanding of violent practice with the motorcycle underworld from criminological and sociological perspectives. This paper will inform readers about an overlooked and under researched underworld culture.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JCRPP-05-2018-0017?af=R","2018-11-03 07:46:13","55","Journal of Criminological Research, Policy and Practice"

                  <p>This article aims to analyze the evolution of Brazilian criminal organization Primeiro Comando da Capital (PCC&mdash;First Command of the Capital), especially its transformation from a group advocating human rights to a transnational violent non-state actor. Created in the late 1990s by inmates at Taubate Prison, PCC is currently a key trigger of violence in South America. Since a massive attack performed in 2006 against security forces, the group continues to be highly operative, also coordinating drugs and arms smuggling in Brazil and abroad. A combination of sources supported this analysis of PCC&rsquo;s evolution, mainly Brazilian official judicial minutes, NGOs reports, and news released from reputable sources. The article shows that PCC has gained strength in the 2010s, expanding illicit business operations in cooperation with other criminal groups. The results suggest that PCC&rsquo;s expansion has changed significantly since their beginnings, into an actor that poses a challenge for the building of peaceful society in all of South America.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12117-018-9354-7","2018-11-05 05:17:45","48","Trends in Organized Crime"

"13201","Embedding Learning and Assessment Within Police Practice: the Opportunities and Challenges Arising From the Introduction of the Peqf in England and Wales","<span><div>Abstract</div>This article reflects upon the development of the Policing Education Qualifications Framework (PEQF) in England and Wales and considers the implications it will have for policing degrees. Given the topic, the article is primarily forward-looking, but it draws upon the experiences of having worked closely with police for over 20 years in designing bespoke policing degree programmes. It is offered as an opinion piece. The PEQF represents a significant step change in the development of police training and education. In particular, it places tertiary education at the centre of all aspects of learning within the police organization. The article welcomes the PEQF as a significant opportunity to develop our understanding of police practice. In particular, it provides an impetus to explore ways of embedding learning and assessment within operational police practice. However, this will require both investment and a substantial change programme to ensure that police services have the appropriate infrastructure to support tertiary levels of learning and assessment. It will also require a cultural shift within both universities and police organizations. Most importantly, if the PEQF is to fulfil its potential, police services will need to embrace, promote, and enable reflective practitioners and become reflective practices in the fullest sense. If this is achieved, I argue, the policing degrees of tomorrow will be radically transformed for the better.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay087/5161114?rss=1","2018-11-05 15:47:41","77","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"
"13202","Frameworks For Credible Causal Inference in Observational Studies of Family Violence","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>Causal questions pervade family violence research, including how and why violence occurs, how it can be prevented, and how to support survivors. Randomization cannot always be used, but in studies of the effects of known causes, regression based observational methods (e.g., propensity score analysis) can be used. Statistical findings are associational only, however, and plausible assumptions are needed to give findings causal meaning. In this review, I suggest two criteria for plausible assumptions that help support credible causal inferences. I then describe and connect three frameworks that provide standards for specifying assumptions in causal inference: the Rubin potential outcomes framework; the Pearl directed acyclic graph framework; and the Campbell framework of validities (e.g., internal validity). These frameworks are widely accepted across the social sciences, facilitating dissemination and critique. Each has strengths and weaknesses, and in studies of the effects of known causes, they may complement each other. Utilizing the standards given to us by these frameworks to select and articulate the assumptions needed for credible causal inference will impact our understanding of family violence and violence prevention more so than studies that cannot be connected as clearly to such standards.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-0011-3","2018-11-05 20:16:41","36","Journal of Family Violence"

                  <p>Many abusers engage in violent behaviors to systematically remove power from and maintain control over their intimate partners. Domestic violence crisis housing organizations aim to increase safety and help survivors regain their power. Yet, little is known about how these settings accomplish this aim. This study drew on empowerment and empowering settings theories to explore how organizational characteristics contributed to empowering practice, and how this practice subsequently promoted survivor empowerment. Researchers employed an exploratory-sequential (QUAL&#10132;quan) mixed-methods design at a domestic violence housing organization. Twelve staff participated in inductive, qualitative interviews. This was followed by deductive, quantitative structured interviews with thirty-three survivors. Qualitative results from staff revealed that the setting was survivor-centered, mission-driven, and distinctive. Staff held basic assumptions about survivors&rsquo; right to self-determination. The relational culture emphasized partnerships, and people also had opportunities to hold meaningful roles within the organization. Setting leaders encouraged autonomy and creativity among all staff. Policies and procedures were also flexible. These setting characteristics were expected to support implementation of empowering practice. Quantitative results from the second phase supported a positive association between empowering practice and increased generalized, and safety-related, empowerment. This exploratory study suggests that setting characteristics are important to consider when understanding the complicated pathways that contribute to survivor empowerment and well-being.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-0016-y","2018-11-06 07:16:44","61","Journal of Family Violence"
"13215","Suspicious Preoperational Activities and Law Enforcement Interdiction of Terrorist Plots","Policing: An International Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose The purpose of this paper is to provide a metric for validating the Nationwide Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR) Initiativeâ€™s (NSI) sixteen-category instrument, which is designed to guide law enforcement in the collection and analysis of suspicious behaviors preceding serious crimes, including terrorist attacks.   Design/methodology/approach Data on suspicious preoperational activities and terrorism incident outcomes in the USA between 1972 and 2013 come from the American Terrorism Study (ATS). Using a mixed-method approach, the authors conduct descriptive and multivariate analyses to examine the frequencies of the least and most prevalent suspicious activities (or SAR indicators) and how they predict the likelihood of terrorism prevention. In addition, the authors contextualize how configurations of SAR indicators are associated with the successful thwarting of terrorism incidents by law enforcement using an analytical method known as conjunctive analysis of case configurations (CACC).   Findings The study reveals several key findings. First, certain behaviors categorized as suspicious, such as making threats, occur more frequently than others. Second, making threats, conducting surveillance and terrorist recruitment/financing predict law enforcement interdiction in terrorism plots, while misrepresentation (or the manufacturing and use of false documents) is more associated with terrorist success. Third, prevalent SAR indicators operate differently in the context of various combinations of suspicious activities to shape the likelihood for law enforcement interdiction.   Research limitations/implications The current studyâ€™s findings may not be generalizable to other forms of violent extremism and terrorism outside of the USA.   Practical implications This study illuminates opportunities for the NSI to provide law enforcement with the necessary tools to reduce terrorism risk and prevent future attacks.   Originality/value To our knowledge, no scholarly work to date has assessed how observable behavioral indicators of suspicious preoperational activities affect the outcomes of terrorist plots.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-08-2018-0125?af=R","2018-11-06 12:33:00","82","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"
"13216","The Benefit of Intelligence Officers","Policing: An International Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the extent to which intelligence officers integrated at the patrol level contribute to successful case outcomes through information sharing.   Design/methodology/approach This study utilizes multinomial logistic regression to analyze the outcomes of three years of Intelligence Officer Reports (IORs) submitted by officers trained in the Phoenix Police Departmentâ€™s Intelligence Officer Program.   Findings The majority of IORs are either tangible case successes or intelligence successes that have the capacity to become these, as opposed to non-successes. The type of success is impacted by a number of predictors. These include case categorization, nature of crime, information-gathering methods and perceived validity of information. Perceived reliability of information was the only non-significant predictor.   Research limitations/implications The study suggests the benefits of looking at multiple predictors of success in understanding the value of information gathered by intelligence officers in the field. Limitations include a fair amount of missing data and potential lack of generalizability to other agencies. Future research will also consider alternative ways of measuring success and the nesting of reports within officers.   Practical implications The study provides insight into key factors for optimizing tangible case outcomes when institutionalizing intelligence-led policing at the patrol level.   Originality/value This is the first study to consider how intelligence-led policing at the patrol level may influence case outcomes, and, in turn, what factors may contribute to this. Findings provide some initial considerations for optimizing desirable case outcomes.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-07-2018-0088?af=R","2018-11-06 12:33:00","112","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

                  <p>Resilience, hardiness, and psychological capital are considered to be important capacities for police officers to cope with and adapt to challenging stressful and potentially traumatic situations. Despite their growing popularity, a systematic review assessing used concepts and instruments for these capacities and synthesizing the results of studies on the predictive values of resilience, hardiness, and psychological capital among police officers is absent. The aim of the present study is to fill this gap of scientific knowledge, and for this purpose, a systematic literature search was conducted using PsycInfo, Pubmed, and Web of Science. We identified 17 cross-sectional and 5 longitudinal studies. Results showed that resilience, hardiness, and psychological capital were studied mostly in relation to physical and mental health variables. No study focused on officers&rsquo; professional functioning. In both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, associations with health variables were very weak to moderate, while cross-sectional studies mostly yielded stronger associations than longitudinal associations. In sum, we found no empirical support for the growing popularity.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9298-5","2018-11-06 23:18:59","60","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"

                  <p>The use of social media as an investigative tool is widespread by law enforcement agencies. In this article, we review the public requests for investigative assistance posted by different law enforcement agencies across the nation to determine what Facebook reactions are associated with additional shares. Using like, love, sad, wow, angry, and funny clicks as proxies for the emotions community members report feeling, the goal is to provide empirically supported advice to law enforcement agencies about how to set the tone of their requests to reach the widest audience, measured by the number of times the post has been shared. When controlling for the type of crime listed, we found a positive relationship between the number of funny or sad clicks and the number of shares, while those posts that elicit angry clicks were shared fewer times. The strength of the relationships and the implications for law enforcement messaging are discussed.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9297-6","2018-11-07 03:17:25","51","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"

                  <span>
                    <h3>Purpose</h3>
                    <p>The current study explores how military service can influence later criminal offending, as informed by the age-graded theory of informal social control. Specifically, the current study is testing whether military service in adulthood acts as a turning point for delinquent youths. We build off previous literature by implementing a research design that addresses important gaps in this literature, such as a more recent military population and comparing self-reported criminal offending to police contacts. Both include overall crime measures and specific crime categories. This study also examines differences in self-reported offending and arrests for different the types of service within the military.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>The current study uses a nationally representative sample of delinquent youths from the Add Health. We employ propensity score matching and logistic regression to test the effects of military service on self-reported criminal offending and arrests.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>Our results suggest that military service reduces future overall self-reported criminal offending for delinquent youths. However, the only specific category of crime influenced is drug arrests. Additionally, we find that those in the military reserves are substantially more likely to engage in drug crime than those with active duty service.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>The findings of the current study not only address many gaps in the current literature but also postulate a reason for the mixed findings in the literature. In addition, the results indicate that the criminal justice system may treat military servicemen and servicewomen differently than those with no military service on minor forms of crime. Limitations and policy implications are also discussed.</p>

                  <p>Using data from the Canadian General Social Survey-Victimization main file, this study assessed the relationship between spousal violence victimization and attitudes towards police. In a nationally representative study of male and female Canadians, we conducted multinomial logistic regression analyses to evaluate the extent to which spousal violence was related to evaluations of police performance [in terms of (a) enforcing the law, (b) responding to calls, (c) being easy to talk to, (d) supplying information to reduce crime, (e) treating people fairly, (f) keeping people safe, and (g) overall confidence in the police] after controlling for socio-demographic and neighborhood characteristics. In follow up analyses, we evaluated if victims of spousal violence who had police contact as a direct result of the violence differed from spousal violence victims who did not have police contact. As hypothesized, spousal violence victimization was significantly and negatively associated with ratings of police performance and confidence in the police in all areas. Counter to our hypotheses, we found no significant differences in attitudes towards police related to police contact; however significant differences were found among survivors based on socio-demographic, violence severity, and neighborhood characteristics. Despite twenty years of policies to improve police response to spousal violence, negative sentiments towards police on the part of victims persist. Officer training programs that specifically address relational aspects of policing, in addition to educational aspects, are recommended to improve survivor-police relations.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-0017-x","2018-11-08 15:17:48","39","Journal of Family Violence"

                  <span>
                    <h3>Objectives</h3>
                    <p>We propose and test a multilevel theoretical model of crime concentration by combining criminal opportunity and social disorganization into a single hierarchical model. Our theoretical model simultaneously answers calls to integrate routine activities theory and social disorganization theory and provides a logical framework for understanding the connections between neighborhood context and micro-spatial environmental conditions.</p>

                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>To test our theory we used multilevel negative binomial regression with controls for spatial dependence to estimate street segment level crime counts.</p>

                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>Findings showed the expected direct effects on street segment-level violent and property crime of both micro- and neighborhood-level characteristics. Our results for cross-level interaction effects provided evidence neighborhood context moderates the association between street segment-level variables and crime. Model comparisons using likelihood ratio tests revealed that including neighborhood-level characteristics improved explanatory power relative to single level models.</p>

                  <span>
                    <h3>Objective</h3>
                    <p>Truancy in adolescence is related to detrimental developmental outcomes over the life-course, including a greater risk for delinquency during adolescence and offending in adulthood. This paper presents results from the Ability School Engagement Program (ASEP): a Third Party Policing partnership between schools and police that sought to disrupt the relationship between truancy and delinquency by communicating, in a procedurally fair dialogue, the legal responsibilities of parents to ensure their children attend school. This paper examines the impact of ASEP on antisocial behavior and the modifying effects of ASEP on the relationship between willingness to go to school and antisocial behavior.</p>

                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>ASEP was evaluated under randomized field trial conditions, where 102 truanting young people from a highly disadvantaged urban area in Brisbane, Australia, were randomly assigned to either the ASEP intervention or the business-as-usual condition.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>Utilizing four waves of survey data collected over a 2-year time period, we found evidence that ASEP was related to decreases in self-reported antisocial behavior throughout the 2&nbsp;years study. We also find that ASEP lessened the negative relationship between willingness to go to school and self-reported antisocial behavior for those in the experimental condition up to 1&nbsp;year post random allocation.</p>

                    <p>Partnerships between schools and police that communicate, in a procedurally fair way, parental legal responsibilities for their children to attend school holds promise for increasing a truanting young person&rsquo;s willingness to go to school and reducing their self-reported antisocial behaviour, at least in the short run.</p>

"13486","Mapping the Age of Official Desistance For Adult Offenders: Implications For Research and Policy","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Purpose</h3>
                    <p>The age-crime curve is a well-known &ldquo;fact&rdquo; in criminology; yet, historically, attention to the interplay between chronological age and offending has focused almost exclusively on the first half of the curve (i.e., onset, rapid escalation, and peak in mid to late adolescence). This study advances understanding of the relationship between offending and age for the second half of the age-crime curve (i.e., during the decline in offending) by studying <em>when</em> desistance happens in young adulthood and beyond.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>Synthesizing data from 15 US-based longitudinal studies, this research triangulates the timing of official desistance by systematically mapping the age of last criminal justice contact (e.g., arrest, police contact) by age of last follow-up for offenders who continue offending beyond &ldquo;normative&rdquo; adolescent offending.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>On average, official desistance occurs within a tightly clustered period early in the life course (i.e., late 20s to early 30s). Even among those followed well into adulthood (age 30 or older), the average age of last criminal justice contact was 35 with later ages of desistance driven by arrests for drug offenses. Observed patterns hold when data are disaggregated by sex, race, type of sample, source of data, and accounting for incarceration. Data censoring (i.e., length of follow-up) strongly impacts estimates of desistance.</p>

                    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>The finding that official desistance largely occurs in early adulthood is inconsistent with US criminal justice policy. We discuss these policy considerations (e.g., sentencing and incapacitation) as well as methodological (e.g., data collection efforts) and theoretical (e.g., identification and meaning of desister or persister) implications.</p>

"13487","Psychological Correlates of Perceived Ethnic Discrimination in Europe: A Meta-Analysis.","Objective: Many studies point to the negative impact of discrimination on the psychological and social functioning of ethnic minority persons. The realization of these studies across multiple European countries enables a systematization of this knowledge, which is our goal in the present work. Method: This study presents a systematic review and a meta-analysis of the correlates of perceived ethnic discrimination among ethnic minority persons living in European countries. Results: The analyses of 121 effect sizes reveal that discrimination is positively associated with symptoms of psychiatric disturbances, depression, psychosis, perceived stress, and externalizing behavior. Discrimination is also negatively associated with the self-esteem, positive evaluation of life, self-efficacy/mastery, well-being, and psychological adaptation of migrants. The results show that the strength of these relationships is, in some cases, moderated by persons&rsquo; gender, age, and ethnicity and countries&rsquo; multicultural preference and countries&rsquo; rating in the Migrant Integration Policies Index (MIPEX), namely, in regard to labor market mobility, permanent residence, and antidiscrimination policies. Conclusions: The detrimental effect of discrimination on many psychosocial dimensions emphasizes the need for governmental agencies to develop systemic and concrete interventions to decrease ethnic prejudice in Europe. Moreover, the results show that fostering multiculturalism, and implementing broad antidiscrimination policies has a protective function in the face of discrimination. Enforcing the implementation of these policies can be a fundamental way to promote the psychological adjustment of ethnic minority persons.

"13488","The Relationship Between Bias-Based Peer Victimization and Depressive Symptomatology Across Sexual and Gender Identity.","Objective: The current study examined the prevalence of seven types of bias-based victimization (sexual orientation, gender, expression of gender, race or ethnicity, disability, religion, and physical appearance), with an emphasis on identifying similarities and differences by sexual and gender identity, and explored the association between victimization and depressive symptomatology for different subgroups. Method: Data from the Teen Health and Technology Study were collected nationally online between 2010 and 2011 from 5,542 13- to 18-year-old youths in the United States. Results: Half of all youth reported experiencing some form of bias-based victimization. Sexual and gender minority youth were more likely than heterosexually identified and cisgender youth to perceive that they had been targeted because of their sexual orientation, gender, gender expression, physical appearance, or religion. Cisgender girls were also more likely to experience bias-based victimization compared with cisgender boys. Being targeted because of one&rsquo;s appearance was associated with concurrent odds of depressive symptomatology for nearly all youth. Victimization due to one&rsquo;s perceived or actual sexual orientation or victimization due to one&rsquo;s gender expression was only associated with increased odds of depressive symptomatology for heterosexual and cisgender youth, respectively. Conclusions: Findings from the current study add to the growing body of research documenting the heightened risk for experiencing multiple types of bias-based victimization among sexual and gender minority youth. They further emphasize the importance of making distinctions within subgroups of sexual and gender minority youth. The emotional consequences of bias-based victimization for youth require that prevention should be a high priority for schools and communities.

"13489","The Effects of Intersecting Stigma: A Longitudinal Examination of Minority Stress, Mental Health, and Substance Use Among Black, Latino, and Multiracial Gay and Bisexual Men.","Objective: Although Black, Latino, and multiracial gay and bisexual men (GBM) are disproportionately affected by psychological and behavioral health inequities facing GBM more broadly in the United States (Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention, 2017), there is a dearth of research examining how their experiences of intersectional stigma contribute to these trends. Based in minority stress and intersectionality theories, this study examined the main and intersectional effects of racial discrimination and gay rejection sensitivity on emotion regulation difficulties, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and later drug use and heavy drinking. Method: We collected longitudinal data from 170 GBM of Black, Latino, or multiracial descent. Measurements included baseline racial discrimination, gay rejection sensitivity, and emotion regulation difficulties, 6-month depressive and anxiety symptoms, and baseline to 12-month heavy drinking and drug use. We analyzed data using longitudinal structural equation models. Results: Our results indicated that racial discrimination and its interaction with gay rejection sensitivity were significantly associated with higher levels of emotion regulation difficulties, which predicted higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms at 6 months, which, in turn, predicted higher levels of heavy drinking, but not drug use, at 12 months. Moreover, the total indirect effect from the stigma variables to heavy drinking was statistically significant. Conclusions: These findings indicate that it is critical for researchers and clinicians to consider the effects of intersecting racial and sexual minority stigma on emotion regulation in the persistence of psychological and behavioral health inequities facing Black, Latino, and multiracial GBM.

"13490","Hate and Violence: Addressing Discrimination Based on Race, Ethnicity, Religion, Sexual Orientation, and Gender Identity.","Social scientists have a potentially important role to play in combatting discrimination and hate-motivated aggression, as has been noted for over 50 years. Nonetheless, there is still relatively little research in this area, despite increasing recognition of discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, and other characteristics. One of the most important scientific trends in research on both discrimination and violence has been recognition of the intersectionality among many of these phenomena, including the intersection of characteristics that confer privilege or disadvantage, of different types of hate-motivated aggression, or among hate-motivated aggression and other forms of victimization. Much work still needs to be done to unpack the diverse sources and complex nature of prejudicial attitudes. In light of current events around the world, we are in urgent need of evidence-based approaches for prevention and intervention that focus both on individuals who commit hate-motivated aggression and those who are the targets of such behaviors. In this introduction to the special issue on hate and violence, we highlight key themes of a series of articles that advance our knowledge in this area. Given that they cover some, but not all, of the topics related to discrimination, we also present several recommendations for future research.

"13491","Addressing the Impact of Racism on Veterans of Color: A Race-Based Stress and Trauma Intervention.","Objective: Veterans of color represent a unique intersection of individuals at risk of experiencing racialized discrimination during their military service and of developing negative mental health outcomes. At the same time, there has been little guidance for Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health-care providers in how to address these clinical issues in a culturally competent manner. This article describes a group-based intervention targeting race-based stress and trauma among veterans implemented at 4 different sites. Method: The authors describe the development and application of this intervention, including information about development of the group and general aims as well as the process of implementing the group across settings. Results: The authors address broad factors to consider when implementing the group, including navigating diversity dimensions within the group and addressing provider cultural competence and identity. Finally, the authors review recommendations for future directions for implementing the group within and outside of a VA setting, seeking institutional support for the group, and developing measures to assess the efficacy of the group. Conclusions: The intervention described in this article has the potential to serve as a model for development of similar interventions both within VA health-care centers and non-VA health-care settings.

"13492","Understanding Experiences With Bullying and Bias-Based Bullying: What Matters and For Whom?","Objective: Using data from the 2015 National Crime Victimization Survey School Crime Supplement, this study examines differential outcomes for youth who report nonbias-based bullying, bias-based bullying on the basis of one social identity, and bias-based bullying on more than one social identity. Method: Data were gathered from youth aged 12 to 18 who reported experiences of bullying (N = 678, 44.2% male). The study tested outcomes regarding (a) rates of afterschool activity participation, (b) participants&rsquo; self-reported fear, and (c) self-reported school avoidance and the relative impact of mediators (the negative effects of bullying, participants&rsquo; perceptions of school safety, social support, and school fairness) across three types of bullying experiences. Results: Results demonstrate that perceptions of school safety, social support, and school fairness generally buffer youth from the negative effects of bullying but that these relationships differ depending on whether the victim experiences nonbias-based bullying or bias-based bullying and depending on if they are targeted because of one or multiple facets of their social identity. Further, results indicate that youth who experience bias-based bullying based on multiple social identities report more negative outcomes of bullying and higher levels of school avoidance and fear than those students who only report one type of bias-based bullying and those who experience non-bias-based bullying. Conclusion: The findings have implications for how schools should implement interventions that address bias and prejudice in bullying and should tailor interventions to the unique experiences of youth who report bias-based and nonbias-based bullying.

"13493","Religiousness and Anti-Gay/lesbian Attitudes: the Mediating Function of Intratextual Religious Fundamentalism.","Objective: The associations between religiousness, authoritarianism, and religious fundamentalism and anti-gay/lesbian (GL) attitudes were examined as well as the possible mediating function of religious fundamentalism on the religiousness&ndash;anti-GL attitude relation. Method: A sample of 249 Jewish Israeli undergraduate students participated in an online survey and filled out self-report measures of religiousness (religious behavior and belief), intratextual religious fundamentalism, right-wing authoritarianism, and anti-GL attitudes. Results: Religiousness, authoritarianism, and religious fundamentalism were all positively and significantly associated with anti-GL attitudes (rs = .69&ndash;.79). Hierarchical regression analysis indicated that religious fundamentalism had a unique contribution to the prediction of these attitudes even after controlling for religiousness and authoritarianism. Respondent gender and target gender did not moderate these relations. Finally, a mediation analysis using boot-strapping methodology indicated that religious fundamentalism and authoritarianism each mediated the religiousness&ndash;anti-GL attitude relation, and multimediation analysis showed that religious fundamentalism and authoritarianism together mediated this relation and that each variable had a unique and significant contribution to the mediating function. Conclusions: There are two paths between religiousness and anti-GL attitudes where one path&mdash;religious fundamentalism&mdash;is inherently religious and the other&mdash;authoritarianism&mdash;is not. It may be more profitable to attenuate anti-GL attitudes, that are associated with anti-GL violence, via the nonreligious path.

"13494","Assessing Racial Trauma With the Trauma Symptoms of Discrimination Scale.","Objective: Racial discrimination can cause symptoms of trauma, yet few tools for measurement exist. African Americans have higher rates of posttraumatic stress disorder and experience more racial discrimination than other groups. This study is a preliminary assessment of the psychometric properties of the Trauma Symptoms of Discrimination Scale (TSDS), a new measure of discriminatory distress measuring anxiety-related trauma symptoms. Method: African American monoracial and biracial undergraduate students (n = 123) completed questionnaires, including the TSDS, the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure, assessments of racial discrimination, and a range of psychopathology measures. The TSDS factor structure was determined with a principal components analysis and internal consistency was assessed. Pearson&rsquo;s correlations were conducted between the TSDS and measures of discrimination and psychopathology. Linear regression was used to predict the TSDS from frequency of discrimination. Results: Item loadings suggested 4 components: (a) uncontrollable hyperarousal, (b) feelings of alienation, (c) worries about future negative events, and (d) perceiving others as dangerous. All measures of discrimination significantly predicted symptoms of trauma, even when accounting for prior traumatic experiences. Conclusions: Preliminary evidence supports the validity of the TSDS for the measurement of anxiety-related trauma symptoms due to racial discrimination. All forms of discrimination may contribute to traumatization in African Americans.

"13495","Muslim Mass Shooters Are Perceived As Less Mentally Ill and More Motivated By Religion.","Objective: We test whether prejudice can influence lay attributions of mental illness to perpetrators of violence. Specifically, we examine whether people with negative attitudes toward Muslims perceive Muslim mass shooters as less mentally ill than non-Muslim shooters. Method: Study 1 compares attributions of mental illness to Muslim and non-Muslim perpetrators of recent mass shootings. Studies 2 and 3 experimentally test whether a mass shooter described in a news article is seen as less mentally ill when described as being a Muslim, compared with when described as a Christian (Study 2) and when religion is not mentioned (Study 3). Study 4 tests whether a Muslim shooter is seen as less mentally ill than a Christian shooter, even when both shooters have symptoms of mental illness. Results: In all studies, Muslim shooters were seen as less mentally ill than non-Muslim shooters, but only by those with negative views toward Muslims. Conclusion: Those with anti-Muslim prejudices perceive Muslim mass shooters as less mentally ill, likely to maintain culpability and fit narratives about terrorism. This may reinforce anti-Muslim attitudes by leading those with anti-Muslim prejudice to overestimate the amount of violence inspired by groups like the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) relative to extremist groups from other ideologies.

"13496","The Antisemitism-Related Stress Inventory: Development and Preliminary Psychometric Evaluation.","Objective: This article describes the development and preliminary psychometric evaluation of the Antisemitism-Related Stress Inventory (ARSI), a multidimensional measure of the frequency and impact of antisemitic experiences of American Jews. As the first known attempt to measure antisemitism-related stress, the ARSI represents a novel contribution in this area. Method: Adult, American Jewish respondents (N = 500) completed a battery of measures, including 87 initial items for possible inclusion in the ARSI. An exploratory factor analysis determined the factor structure of and best items for inclusion in the final scale. Correlations with established measures of stress, satisfaction with life, self-esteem, and Jewish religious and cultural identity were computed to explore concurrent validity. Results: The final 30-item ARSI included three subscales capturing Individual Experiences of antisemitism (14 items), Collective Experiences of antisemitism (11 items), and experiences related to one&rsquo;s Personal Safety (five items). The ARSI demonstrated strong internal consistency and concurrent validity with measures of stress and satisfaction with life. Jewish cultural identity predicted a higher frequency of collective experiences of anti-Semitism, whereas religious identity predicted fewer individual experiences of antisemitism. Conclusion: Findings support the ARSI as a promising measure to understand the impact of antisemitism on American Jews. These findings are discussed in regard to their specific implications for future research, including the need for further investigation into the impact of antisemitism on the psychological health and well-being of American Jews and complex relations with multiple aspects of Jewish identity.

"13497","A Model of Intersectional Stress and Trauma in Asian American Sexual and Gender Minorities.","Objective: Intersecting minority identities may confer unique risks for stress and trauma. In this article, we reviewed extant research on the processes and outcomes of racial and sexual/gender identity-related (i.e., &ldquo;intersectional&rdquo;) stress and trauma among the understudied population of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) Asian Americans. Specifically, we proposed a model of intersectional stress and trauma in LGBTQ Asian Americans that builds upon elements of minority stress theory for sexual minorities. Method: We used PsycINFO and other online databases and search engines to search for information in developing and describing our model. We included 84 peer-reviewed empirical, qualitative, and review/theoretical articles, as well as books, book chapters, unpublished data, and organization reports from 1970 to 2016. Results: In the model, we detail how structural oppression, cultural norms and stigma, interpersonal discrimination, internalized minority stress cognitions, and maladaptive coping and poor social support interact in contributing to negative mental and sexual health outcomes in LGBTQ Asian Americans, as a function of their intersecting racial and sexual/gender identities. Conclusions: LGBTQ Asian Americans face unique stressors that can lead to traumatization. Future research should empirically validate our model of intersectional stress and trauma, increase scientific representation of all LGBTQ Asian American subgroups, and emphasize the LGBTQ Asian American identity as multifaceted and intersectional. Finally, components of our model appear to be promising areas for intervention. However, we urge clinicians to consider the utility of treatments from the perspective of indigenous practices and healing, compared with adaptation from Western, heteronormative treatment approaches.

"13500","What Is the Privatization of Policing?","<span><div>Abstract</div>The politics of austerity have deepened market penetration across the UK policing sector, bringing into effect an array of new policing assemblages which cut across the public&ndash;private divide like never before and defy simple categorization. However, public discourse has not kept pace with this fast-changing reality, all too often reducing these assemblages into an amorphous singularity&ndash;&lsquo;privatization&rsquo;&ndash;towards which one is either unambiguously for or against. This article accordingly sets out the analytical tools for developing a more nuanced discourse on the privatization of policing. It first develops a new typology of privatization across five categories: function, formulation of private sphere, trigger of privatization, regulatory influence of the state, and relationship to the ideal-type police monopoly. It then operationalizes this typology using four recent examples of privatization drawn from the UK policing sector. It lastly clarifies how this typology can be used to inform discourse on the privatization of policing.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay085/5167189?rss=1","2018-11-09 06:48:14","82","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"
"13501","This Service Terminates Here? Politics, Practitioner Perspectives, and the Future of Railway Policing in Scotland","<span><div>Abstract</div>Following the devolution of railway policing under the Scotland Act 2016, the Railway Policing (Scotland) Act 2017 set in motion a process that, if completed, will see the British Transport Police's Scottish Division integrated into Scotland&rsquo;s relatively new national police force, Police Scotland. The post-legislative journey has, however, proven far more challenging than supporters of integration envisaged. Drawing upon primary and secondary data, this article investigates the integration process to date and shows how a politicized and poorly managed transition programme left employees disillusioned, and fostered a deep strain of mistrust towards the project. With escalating costs, a lack of practitioner buy-in, the potential loss of experienced officers and staff, longer-term risks to the remaining BTP organization, and no clear evidence of benefits, the article concludes that the Scottish Government should call off full integration and consider an alternative approach towards the devolution of railway policing.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay074/5167194?rss=1","2018-11-09 06:48:14","51","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"

                  <p>Private security work is seen as traditionally outsourced &lsquo;non-core&rsquo; work and a low-status job, and its skills are undervalued. Further, security guards tend to receive little attention from their employers regarding the aspects influencing the quality of work life (QWL). To contribute to an analysis of this issue, this work presents an exploratory approach to assess the QWL of bank security guards. By conducting a case study in 43 branches of a Brazilian city, categories and thresholds were defined to classify the QWL level, and the quartiles analysis was suggested to identify the most critical items that must be prioritized to improve the QWL of bank security guards. As a result, the most critical items concerning the QWL are related to remuneration, career growth, equipment weight and non-compliance with safety standards.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1057/s41284-018-0159-9","2018-11-09 14:19:10","34","Security Journal"

                  <p>More data is needed about the pathways through which intimate partner violence (IPV) impacts the economic well-being of survivors. The current study assesses the moderating influence of social support on the association between economic abuse (EA) and economic hardship. Female participants (<em>n</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;435) were recruited to participate in a web-based survey which included standardized measures of EA, other forms of IPV, domains of social support, and economic hardship. Analysis included bivariate and multivariate regression with an investigation into interaction effects.Experiencing EA was significantly correlated with economic hardship, even with extent of physical and emotional IPV controlled. Both tangible and appraisal support had significant negative association with extent of material hardship. Significant interactions between forms of social support and economic abuse were observed. For those at high levels of economic abuse, support had less influence on economic hardship. A mix of direct economic aid, advocacy, education and support could provide a blueprint for addressing the economic hardship experiences of community-dwelling survivors of economic abuse. A comprehensive response to EA requires interventions aimed directly at economically controlling and exploitative tactics, including credit building, individual economic advocacy, and education. Interventions that seek to enhance survivors&rsquo; access to social support may be necessary but not sufficient to buffer the impacts of violence on survivors&rsquo; economic outcomes.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-0019-8","2018-11-10 00:18:10","79","Journal of Family Violence"

                  <p>This exploratory and formative study draws from discursive psychology to gain insights into how young people construct their experiences of parental domestic violence and abuse (DVA) and how they claim to understand the occurrence of DVA within their home. Data from interviews with 13 young people (18&ndash;26&nbsp;years old) who reported DVA in their families of origin were analyzed using a discursive psychological approach. Analysis revealed two interrelated themes. Theme 1, &lsquo;&ldquo;<em>How it was&rdquo;</em>: constructions of DVA&rsquo; identified that the young people had difficulty in recognizing psychological aspects of this phenomenon as DVA. However, as these behaviors also deviated from the normative expectations of intra-parental behaviors, the occurrence of psychological DVA led to ambiguity and confusion. Paradoxically, the occurrence of extreme physical DVA was readily recognized as DVA, and this worked to facilitate disclosure, discussion, and help-seeking. Theme 2, &lsquo;Barriers and facilitators to talking with mothers about DVA&rsquo;, identified how young people&rsquo;s reported perceptions of their mother&rsquo;s role in DVA were related to the likelihood that they had conversations about DVA with their mothers. The occurrence of extreme physical DVA, which unambiguously placed responsibility for the DVA with the perpetrator, who in the cases presented here were male, was reported to enable conversations around DVA between the young people and their mothers. Findings suggest a need to adapt discourses to make understandings of the psychological aspect of DVA more accessible to young people, so they can name and make sense of their experiences.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-0013-1","2018-11-10 03:18:31","93","Journal of Family Violence"

                  <p>The aim of the current study was to obtain a snapshot of police officer&rsquo;s beliefs about factors that may influence the outcome of the investigative interview with suspects. We created a 26-item survey that contained statements around three specific themes: best interview practices, confessions and interviewee vulnerabilities. Police officers (<em>N</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;101) reported their beliefs on each topic by indicating the level of agreement or disagreement with each statement. The findings indicated that this sample of officers held beliefs that were mostly consistent with the literature. However, many officers also responded in the mid-range (neither agree nor disagree) which may indicate they are open to developing literature-consistent beliefs of the topics. Understanding what officers believe about factors within the investigative interview may have implications for future training. It may also help explain why some officers do not consistently apply best practices (i.e. strong counterfactual beliefs) versus officers who reliably apply literature-consistent practices to their interviews (i.e. knowledge-consistent beliefs).</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9301-1","2018-11-10 15:18:14","48","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"

                  <p>The appropriate recording of hate crime by state authorities (most usually by the police) has been recognized internationally as important to addressing hate crime. However, little scholarly attention has been paid to the role played by civil society in monitoring hate crime. This article will elaborate a range of purposes fulfilled by civil society organisations in collecting data on the extent and motivations of hate crime occurring in a given jurisdiction. Drawing on in-depth interviews with civil society organisations engaged in conducting third party monitoring of hate crime in one such jurisdiction, we will document the manner in which such monitoring systems (a) provide a means of reporting hate crime; (b) provide minority communities a means of reporting hate crime; (c) serve as a comparator to potentially unrepresentative official statistics where these are collected; (d) provide an evidence base for legislative change; and (e) provide a platform to affirm victims&rsquo; naming of their experiences as hate crimes. This internationally transferable taxonomy of the functions of civil society monitoring systems, is complemented by additional insights into the particular significance of such mechanisms in jurisdictions in which the construct of hate crime is not acknowledged in the justice system. On a critical note, the article will identify victim support as a natural extension of hate crime recording systems, noting that civil society organisations collecting data on hate crime in Ireland do not fulfil this remit. In summary, we argue for the value of civil society hate crime reporting systems as a source of challenge to otherwise hegemonic state constructions of jurisdictional hate crime. We advocate for international bodies to incorporate the financial support of civil society organisations into their monitoring functions on this basis.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10610-018-9403-4","2018-11-11 06:17:56","68","European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research"

                  <p>It is now widely accepted that living with domestic abuse (DA) can significantly affect children, with the effects of DA continuing to be felt into adulthood. The common conceptualisation of children as passive &lsquo;witnesses&rsquo; of DA and the failure to recognise them as direct &lsquo;victims&rsquo; in their own right, separate from adult victims, can act as a major barrier for professionals responding to children within this context. The first professionals with whom many child victims of DA come into contact often are members of the police. Yet, little is still known about how children and police officers experience these encounters. The aim of this paper is to conduct a narrative review of the existing literature on the police response to children at DA call outs through the lens of <em>Emotional Intelligence</em> (Goleman <span>1996</span>). Reviewed studies state that a large number of police officers reported feelings of overwhelm and uncertainty at incidents of DA involving children. Children reported significant differences in empathy of officers, a key tenet of EI, which impacted their feelings of safety and visibility at incidents of DA. DA incidents are an emotionally challenging aspect of police work and most officers do not appear to have the skills to manage this effectively. The significance of speaking with children in these traumatic situations cannot be understated. EI appears to make an important contribution to the overall efficacy of officers at incidents of DA involving children.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-0018-9","2018-11-12 19:33:08","67","Journal of Family Violence"

At its core, EBP rests on a central tenet: police decision-making should be &lsquo;based on scientific evidence about what works best&rsquo; (Sherman, L. W. (1998). Evidence Based Policing. Washington, DC: Police Foundation). While this proposition seems straightforward, it places a responsibility on police leaders for which they may be unprepared. Understanding how best to commission, resource, appreciate the strengths and limitations of and/or make actionable the products of research, requires senior officers to have some level of familiarity with the research process. One potential source of that knowledge is police leader training and education. However, no one has yet explored the question of whether police leadership programs are adequately preparing senior officers for the world of EBP. To examine this issue, the authors present the results of an analysis of 29 in-depth qualitative interviews with senior Canadian police officers.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay086/5174706?rss=1","2018-11-13 05:49:15","153","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"

Methodologically, the new model takes lead from the abstract mathematical operations and canonical transformations suggested by L&eacute;vi-Strauss for the structural study of myth. The assumption is that mass rapes are fueled by a specific cultural activism that activates a cultural ideology that makes mass rapes effective in a military strategy of ethnic cleansing.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10611-018-9800-0","2018-11-13 15:33:42","52","Crime, Law and Social Change"

                  <p>Ever since the terrorist attacks of 9/11, counter-terrorism legislation has been argued to be globally focused on a so called &lsquo;suspect community&rsquo;: the &lsquo;Muslim community&rsquo;. The media, politicians and scholars speak about a new wave of terrorism where &lsquo;Islamic&rsquo; is a common key denominator. Critical research, so far predominantly focused on the United Kingdom, has pointed at unintended consequences arising from political discourse in which a &lsquo;suspect community&rsquo; is constructed, for society as a whole and the &lsquo;suspect community&rsquo; in particular. Building on this research, this study analyses if and how Muslims are also constructed as a &lsquo;suspect community&rsquo; in Dutch political discourse on terrorism in the period 2004-2015. The analysis shows that political discourse in the Netherlands has shifted significantly in this period. Whereas until 2011, terrorism was framed as a problem that originates in society and that is to be solved for society as a whole, it is currently seen as a problem that originates in Islam and which needs to be addressed by the &lsquo;Muslim community&rsquo;. All members of that &lsquo;Muslim community&rsquo; are now considered as potentially &lsquo;suspect&rsquo; when they do not openly and explicitly adhere to Western values and take action to distance themselves from the &lsquo;Jihadist enemy&rsquo;. Further societal implications of this discourse, in which the &lsquo;Muslim community&rsquo; is constructed as a &lsquo;suspect community,&rsquo; are also discussed.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10611-018-9802-y","2018-11-13 15:33:42","51","Crime, Law and Social Change"

                  <p>Asian criminology is a fast-growing area of criminological research, but its influence on the international criminological landscape is largely unknown. The current article examines scholarly influence by studying citations in four international criminology journals (AJC&mdash;<em>Asian Journal of Criminology</em>, ANZ&mdash;<em>Australian and New Zealand Journal of Criminology</em>, CRIM&mdash;<em>Criminology</em>, and EJC&mdash;<em>European Journal of Criminology</em>) over a 10-year period from 2006 to 2015. Generally, the most-cited scholars in AJC overlapped with the most-cited scholars in the other three journals. The most-cited scholars in AJC tended to be based in the USA, working in the area of developmental and life-course criminology, and highly cited in the other three journals. Overall, Robert J. Sampson was the most-cited scholar in these four journals. Few scholars based in Asia were highly cited in ANZ, CRIM, or EJC, at least partly because few Asian scholars authored articles in these journals. We conclude that Asian scholars should be encouraged to carry out research that would interest international scholars and to submit their work for publication not only in AJC but also in other international journals.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11417-018-9279-8","2018-11-13 19:18:34","38","Asian Journal of Criminology"

Not only does prior record contribute to mass incarceration, but prior research has consistently shown that criminal history mediates race effects and exacerbates disparities. In guidelines jurisdictions, criminal history enhancements are partially or primarily employed as proxies for risk prevention. But for the most part these scores were not developed empirically, and, to date, whether scores are valid predictors of risk has gone unexplored. This paper uses survival analysis and area under the curve analysis to examine the predictive efficacy of the Pennsylvania Prior Record Score using a sample of offenders sentenced in Pennsylvania and followed-up for 3&nbsp;years after release (<em>n</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;130,758). The results show that some of the Pennsylvania PRS categories fail to accurately distinguish among offenders based on their likelihood of recidivism. Further, some of the key score components that increase the PRS (and the punishment imposed) have marginal effects on the predictive efficacy of the score, often only increasing the prediction accuracy by a single percentage point. By re-engineering the PRS categories and sub-components, this jurisdiction could recommend less punishment in some cases without any apparent increase in risk to public safety.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12103-018-9460-8","2018-11-14 00:17:34","46","American Journal of Criminal Justice"
"13539","Navigating Get-Tough and Support-Oriented Philosophies For Improving School Safety: Insights From School Administrators and School Safety Staff","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>Schools in the United States are increasingly faced with the challenge of navigating two seemingly contradictory approaches to school safety. On the one hand, they attempt to make schools safer by employing get-tough, punishment-oriented policies. On the other hand, schools promote support-oriented policies that seek to address the root causes of students&rsquo; behavioral issues. Despite considerable advances in research on school safety, little is known about how schools balance the implementation of these two approaches. To address this research gap, we present findings from interviews with school principals, assistant principals, discipline coordinators, police, and district leaders to illustrate how schools navigate the implementation of these competing school safety philosophies. Implications for theory, research, and policy are discussed.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12103-018-9462-6","2018-11-14 03:18:19","32","American Journal of Criminal Justice"
"13540","Construing the Legality of Solitary Confinement: Analysis of United States Federal Court Jurisprudence","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>This article analyzes the constitutional parameters of solitary confinement, administrative segregation, and/or punitive isolation within correctional facilities in the United States. After briefly discussing the harmful effects of isolation and the number of inmates subject to this type of confinement, it explains the U.S. Supreme Court&rsquo;s &ldquo;atypical and significant hardship&rdquo; standard for assessing the legality of segregation. Evaluation of 68 cases decided by the 12&nbsp;U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeals reveals how each Circuit decides when conditions of segregation amount to an &ldquo;atypical and significant hardship&rdquo; for the inmate, creating a liberty interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process clause. Due to the Supreme Court&rsquo;s ambiguity, the Federal Circuit Courts of Appeals lack agreement on (1) when liberty interests attach and (2) which confinement conditions outside of segregation should serve as a comparison baseline to assess &ldquo;atypicality&rdquo; and &ldquo;hardship.&rdquo; While inmates possess limited liberty interests when placed in segregation, the physical and psychological harms wrought by segregation, isolation, and solitary confinement are rarely considered when courts make constitutional determinations of such practices.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12103-018-9463-5","2018-11-14 05:17:51","24","American Journal of Criminal Justice"
"13541","The â€œPliabilityâ€ of Criminological Analyses: Assessing Bias in Regression Estimates Using Monte Carlo Simulations","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Objectives</h3>
                    <p>When biased coefficient and standard error estimates are published, they can result in inaccurate findings which might motivate ineffective&mdash;or harmful&mdash;policy choices and reduce the legitimacy of social scientific research. In this paper, we demonstrate how Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) can be used to evaluate potential bias in estimates.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>We define estimation bias and provide an overview of MCS, which involves three steps. First, data are generated according to model parameters and assumptions. Second, the data are analyzed and estimates are saved. Third, these two steps are repeated 2500 times to yield a distribution of estimates to compare with the original estimates. In our first example of using MCS to evaluate potential bias, we use data from a previous project to estimate an OLS regression model and then assess the consistency of estimates. In our second example, we evaluate published regression model estimates. In the third example, we employ experimental methodology with MCS to show how a correlation estimate would vary if there was a moderating effect of a third variable.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>Standard error estimates in the first example exhibited severe bias due to violated assumptions. The second example showed model estimates were largely unbiased. The third example showed that the strength of a moderating effect is positively related to correlation estimate bias.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>Although MCS have been increasingly used by criminologists, they could be used by a broader body of researchers, instructors, and policymakers to assess and ensure the reliability of reported findings.</p>

                  <p>In supporting survivors of intimate partner violence navigate the criminal justice system, many agencies offer legal and/or court programs guided by an empowerment-based, survivor-centered approach. However, there is limited research examining survivor-centered practice in the context of court services. The goal of this study was to explore the specific skills and strategies used by one sample of family court advocates to conduct survivor-centered safety planning with survivors. Twenty-two recorded family court advocate-survivor sessions were qualitatively explored and survivor-centered strategies for safety planning were identified. Such strategies included open-ended exploration of risks and safety options, paraphrasing survivor-identified risks and safety plans, prioritizing immediate risks, understanding safety strategies and resources, exploring support systems, providing survivor-centered information, and discussing the pros and cons of safety options. Understanding specific skills and strategies that may be utilized by family court advocates can support the field in developing, implementing, training on, supervising, and evaluating survivor-centered approaches.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-0020-2","2018-11-14 18:22:00","27","Journal of Family Violence"

"13557","Street Pastors in the Night-Time Economy: Harmless Do-Gooders Or A Manifestation of A New Right Agenda?","Safer Communities, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose The purpose of this paper, which follows an earlier paper published in this journal, is to explore the shape and nature of plural policing through the lens of New Right ideology. It aims to reinforce the understanding that policy is driven by both neoliberalism and neoconservatism, not simply the former. In policy terms, it uses the vehicle of a faith-based initiative â€“ the Street Pastors â€“ to consider how the strategic line of plural policing may be shifting.   Design/methodology/approach The research that informs this paper spans 2012 to the present day incorporating a multi-method evaluation, an ongoing observation with informal interviews, and two e-mail surveys directed at university students in Plymouth and Cardiff. In addition, the authors carried out a critical analysis of a research report produced by van Steden and a documentary analysis of national newspaper reports of Street Pastor activities.   Findings In a previous paper, the authors provided evidence to support the contention of Jones and Lister (2015) that there has been a shift in the landscape of plural policing. The Street Pastors initiative is a movement from â€œpolicing by the stateâ€ towards â€œpolicing from belowâ€. The authors suggest here that there may be evidence to speculate that another shift might occur from â€œpolicing from belowâ€ to â€œpolicing through the stateâ€. Ultimately, the authors contend, such shifts reflect and serve the dominance of New Right ideology in social and public policy.   Research limitations/implications The research limitations of this paper are twofold. First, the surveys had very small sample sizes and so the results should be treated with caution. The authors have underlined this in detail where necessary. Second, it is informed by a series of related though discrete research activities. However, the authors regard this as a strength also, as the findings are consistent across the range. The implications relate to the way in which policy designed to encourage partnership might lead to off-loading public responsibilities on the one hand, while allowing co-option on the other hand.   Social implications The practical implications are indivisible from the social implications in the authorsâ€™ view. The neoliberal and neoconservative dimensions of the current dominant ideology are using local initiatives to save public money and reify disciplinary features of social and public policy.   Originality/value The originality of this research relates to the way it was conducted, drawing together the products of discrete but related activities. It adds to the growing research landscape involving the Street Pastors, an important faith-based, publicly backed initiative. But more importantly, it underlines how the two dimensions of New Right ideology come together in practice. The example of the Street Pastors indicates, through the lens of plural policing, how voluntary and local initiatives are being used to refocus the priorities of social and public policy.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/SC-05-2018-0015?af=R","2018-11-15 08:35:09","74","Safer Communities"

                    <p>Test the <em>Pax Monopolista</em> hypothesis using the case of <em>Primeiro Comando da Capital</em> (PCC)&mdash;a prison gang turned drug trade organization&mdash;in the city of S&atilde;o Paulo.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>Difference-in-difference. Using unique data to identify PCC entry in geographically well-delimited but socially fragile areas&mdash;namely, <em>favelas</em>&mdash;we explore variations in the timing of the expansion the PCC
      across the city of S&atilde;o Paulo to establish the impact of PCC presence on crime.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>PCC presence is associated with an 11% reduction in violent crime in the <em>favelas</em> that PCC entered
      during the period 2005&ndash;2009. No discernible impact on property crime was found.</p>

                    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>Results are compatible with the main theoretical reasons why the monopolization of criminal
      activity may lead to a reduction in crime.</p>

                  <p>The use of security measures within schools has increased dramatically over the past few decades. These proliferations are often touted by teachers, school administrators, politicians, and the public as necessary for improving student safety. Though research in this area is growing, we know little about how increased use of school security measures relates to both student and parental perceptions of school safety. Using data from wave one of the 2002 Educational Longitudinal Study, the current study investigates the relationship between the use of security measures in schools and student and parent assessments of safety. Findings from multi-level models indicate that school security measures are, generally, related to decreased perceptions of safety by both parents and students. Implications of these findings are addressed.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12103-018-9461-7","2018-11-16 21:18:44","37","American Journal of Criminal Justice"

                  <p>Since the Northern disturbances of 2001 and the terrorist attacks of September 11th<sup>,</sup> the UK government has changed the focus of policies from those that predominantly focused on British Muslims&rsquo; Asian identity, to those that focus on British Muslims&rsquo; religious identity. The fracturing of the Asian identity has been evident in the political discourses on the &lsquo;war on terror&rsquo; and community cohesion, with both defining British Muslims through their religious identity, as opposed to their Asian identity, an identity for which inter Asian commonality existed. This article draws on research that was conducted on British Muslims&rsquo; perceptions of social policy since the 1980s and explores the extent to which changes in governmental policies have impacted British Muslims&rsquo; perceptions of commonality with non-British Muslims. The article demonstrates how the &lsquo;war on terror&rsquo; and community cohesion are negatively impacting social cohesion through making British Muslims feel isolated and marginalised in society. The implications of the findings are discussed in relation to the radicalisation of British Muslims and the growing influence of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10611-018-9804-9","2018-11-17 19:19:35","50","Crime, Law and Social Change"

                  <p>Empirical support for procedural justice theory in criminology is robust in the developed Western countries, whereas the results are mixed for non-Western or less-developed countries. Some scholars (e.g., Reisig et al. <em>Journal of Criminal Justice and Security, 14</em>(2), 147&ndash;164, <span>2012</span>) argue that the generalizability of procedural justice theory may be limited to particular sociological settings, such as democratic and industrialized societies. The current study aims to review the international generalizability of the theory and to test the theory utilizing a South Korean driver sample. The results show that procedural fairness predicted legitimacy and speeding intention. However, perceived legitimacy does not mediate the association between perceived procedural fairness and speeding intention for Korean drivers. Considering the findings from the current study and previous studies, it seems that industrialization may not be a sufficient condition linking perceived legitimacy and compliance, but democracy may be the most significant precursor for the theory to work.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11417-018-9278-9","2018-11-20 00:34:25","29","Asian Journal of Criminology"

                  <p>Globalization has been linked with many social problems, though little research has examined its relationship with software piracy. The ramifications of software piracy may vary across countries leading to varied criminal justice responses. More developed countries, which produce the most software and stand to gain the most from its protection, use diplomatic leverage to strengthen piracy laws in less developed countries. Consequently, lesser-developed countries are forced to adopt rigorous policies for IP protection. As such, we hypothesize that globalization will decrease software piracy rates over time. Using a modified random effect model, the current study examines the within and between countries effects of globalization on software piracy rates over time in 103 countries across a period of 14&nbsp;years. Results indicate that globalization is significantly associated with a decrease in software piracy within and between countries over time while controlling for important time-varying and time invariant predictors. Interaction effects suggest that the relationship between globalization and software piracy is less pronounced in Asian countries and more pronounced in Latin American countries. In sum, some crimes, like software piracy, may be deterred if there are strong enough incentives and international pressures to regulate such crime through legislative and policy reforms.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10611-018-9805-8","2018-11-20 00:34:44","45","Crime, Law and Social Change"

                  <p>This paper provides a comprehensive and critical look at the current state of multinational research on women&rsquo;s offending and scrutinizes how this knowledge has been derived. The importance of global research for theoretical advancement is discussed. Questions about the validity of official data estimates as proxies for women&rsquo;s offending in cross-national research focus on the extent to which research findings are reflecting behavioural differences among the populations being studied or other exogenous factors, such as policing, policy and data collection. This paper carries on a tradition of inquiry into the data by presenting visual heuristics to facilitate easy interpretation of definitional differences in specified crime types across time and between country and by determining societal factors that correlate with the &ldquo;dark figure of crime&rdquo; when contrasting arrests and reported victimization across nations. The findings suggest cautious optimism for proceeding with rigorously compiled multinational official data sources to advance this important field of work.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10610-018-9402-5","2018-11-20 12:20:09","39","European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research"

                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>A pre-test, post-test experimental design was constructed to examine changes in self-esteem, empathy, optimism, pessimism, compassion, and social competence between juveniles who were randomly assigned to the canine-assisted activity program and to the standard conditions of the detention center without access to the program. Two-way and repeated measures ANOVA models are used to assess the differential effect of the program.</p>

                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>The dog-training program evaluated in this study did not differentially benefit nor did it harm participants in relation to juveniles who received the standard operating practices and procedures of the detention center.</p>

                    <p>Generalized conclusions about the effectiveness of dog-training programs in secure correctional facilities should not be made from this study. Despite the unique program model structure used in this study, the results demonstrate that once selection effects are mitigated through randomization, the mere exposure to a dog-training program does not translate to improved outcomes. The results raise more questions about the influence of selection effects on reported findings and stimulate inquiry on dog-training program models, research designs used to assess program effects, and the importance of intermediate interventions.</p>

                  <span>
                    <h3>Method</h3>
                    <p>The system of tracking featured a written paper and pencil report on each residence visited, with entries audited against GPS records of where each reporting officer was located at the times and places listed in the written report. Body-worn video records were used to triangulate the written and GPS records. The policy tracked was the goal of face-to-face contact with residents of four houses on either side of each burgled residence, plus the initially burgled home, or nine visits per burglary.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>Of the potential 387 homes to visit after each burglary, only 266 occupied dwellings were identified, of which 230 (93%) were visited by Police Community Service Officers (PCSOs) assigned, 141 of them within 2&nbsp;days after the initial burglary (61%). These visits and second visits resulted in 154 face-to-face discussions warning occupants about an elevated risk of burglary (58%). No contact or leaflet at all was delivered to 12.5% of all potential properties. The case study showed that the tracking and feedback was instrumental in delivering these outputs.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>The time and effort needed for supervisors to track the delivery of an evidence-based, tested crime prevention programme does not exceed supervisory time available, making tracking systems of this kind a feasible element of police business as usual.</p>

The Person of Interest Priority Assessment Tool, Trace Investigate and Evaluate, Rasterfahndung, and Analysis of Competing Hypotheses are compared on their performance in the collection, prioritization, and elimination phase of homicide cases in today&rsquo;s digital era. Three recent Dutch homicide cases are used. The use of categories during collection can assist criminal investigators in the early inclusion of the perpetrator into the investigation, however, in this digital era, the number of persons of interest becomes too large to humanly handle. All four methodologies use techniques to assign weight to pieces of evidence; further research is required to evaluate the effectiveness of these techniques when the amount of pieces of evidence explodes. The use of pre-set elimination categories shows the least promising result leaving most persons of interest not-eliminated by the currently used methodologies.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay088/5193738?rss=1","2018-11-21 07:51:56","52","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"

                  <p>The social and communication impairments and other atypical behaviors among those with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) make this subset of the population particularly vulnerable. These vulnerabilities also present a separate set of concerns when they have contact with the criminal justice system, typically as victims or witness of abuse, as offenders or suspicious persons, or lost or missing persons. Specific measures must be taken to improve communication and to avoid misinterpreting communication impairments and other atypical behaviors as an indication of a lack of cooperation, being under the influence of substances, or of guilt/lack of remorse. Without the benefit of having basic knowledge and understanding of autism, criminal justice system professionals will struggle with meeting the needs of those with ASD. The current study explored the level of autism knowledge and awareness of among a sample of 400 undergraduate criminal justice students and possible future criminal justice professionals. The results demonstrated that the sample of students had moderate knowledge of ASD, which did not appear to increase with time in program. Those with greater exposure to people with ASD had more knowledge and understanding than those who did not. Recommendations and implications are discussed.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9302-0","2018-11-21 10:23:59","47","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"

                  <p>We document four patterns of sibling victimization (Persist, New, Desist, and None) across two time points and their association with peer victimization at time two and whether these linkages are apparent in early childhood, middle childhood and adolescence. A telephone survey (<em>N</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;1653) was conducted with a nationally representative sample of U.S. parents with children (age 3&ndash;9) and adolescents (age 10 to 17). The four patterns differed by age, gender, ethnicity and parent education levels but not family structure. The Persist, New and Desist sibling victimization patterns were associated with a greater likelihood of peer victimization. Sibling victimization patterns were unrelated to peer victimization in early childhood but predictive of peer victimization in middle childhood and adolescence. Findings showed that sibling victimization leaves children and adolescents vulnerable to peer victimization. Children and adolescents who experienced chronic sibling victimization (Persist group) were particularly vulnerable to peer victimization. Eliminating sibling victimization could reduce peer victimization in middle childhood and adolescence.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-0021-1","2018-11-21 20:22:06","24","Journal of Family Violence"

                  <p>In response to the growing body of empirical research demonstrating a substantial co-occurrence of intimate partner violence (IPV) and animal abuse, domestic violence shelters are increasingly offering on- or off-site services to care for the pets of abused women accessing shelter services. This paper analyzes all public websites of first-stage shelters in Canada (<em>n</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;337) to offer the first examination of what these shelters are communicating about this co-occurrence of abuse and an appraisal of what services are available to survivors with pets. The findings indicate that less than half of the websites mention pets, and only 1% of shelters report offering on-site pet programs. There are significant relationships between websites addressing the role of pets in both safety planning and help-seeking among abused women and the provision of pet shelter services. The paper concludes with suggestions for pet-related information on domestic violence shelter websites in Canada and elsewhere.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-0023-z","2018-11-21 23:22:48","27","Journal of Family Violence"
"13674","Violence Victimization and Parenting Among Black South African Mothers","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>Black South African women and girls face high rates of violence victimization, including physical, sexual, and emotional abuse in childhood and intimate partner violence (IPV) in adulthood. U.S.-based research suggests that violence victimization predicts parenting difficulties, but this relation has not been examined in a South African context. Among a sample of 99 Black South African female caregivers, we examined rates of child abuse, IPV, and cumulative trauma, and we explored the associations between caregivers&rsquo; victimization history and current parenting quality (i.e., parent-child relationship quality &amp; parental involvement with child). Caregivers completed self-report questionnaires using ACASI software. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that caregivers reporting childhood physical or sexual abuse were less involved with their children. Caregivers with a history of emotional abuse reported significantly worse parent-child relationship quality. Cumulative trauma was associated with worse parental involvement and parent-child relationship quality. Results reveal relatively high rates of interpersonal violence victimization among this convenience sample of Black South African women, as well as unique relations between forms of victimization and specific parenting practices. The findings highlight the importance of behavioral parent training interventions with a focus on specific assessment of parents&rsquo; victimization experiences.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-0022-0","2018-11-22 07:35:33","47","Journal of Family Violence"

With the increase in the use of online transactions, the concerns regarding data security have also increased. To tackle the frauds, lot of research has been done and plethora of papers are available on the related topics. The purpose of this paper is to provide the clear pathway for researchers to move in the direction of development of automated fraud detection system to prevent the fraud during online transaction.   Design/methodology/approach This literature review analyses and compares the different types of techniques for detecting fraud during online transaction. An in-depth study of the most prominent journals has been done and the core methodology of the papers has been presented. This article also shed some light on different types of parameters used in fraud detection techniques during online transaction.   Findings There are vast varieties of various fraud detection techniques, and every technique has completed task in its own way. After studying approximately 41 research papers, 14 books and four reports, in total 30 parameters have been identified and a detailed study of the parameters has been presented. The parameters are also listed with their details that how these parameters are used in the security system for detecting online transaction fraud.   Research limitations/implications This paper provides empirical insight about the parameters and their prominence in the development of automated fraud detection security system of online transaction. This paper encourages the researchers to development of improved fraud detection system.   Practical implications This paper will pave the way for researchers to do a focused research on the fraud detection methodologies. The analysis will help in zeroing down the most prevalent topic of research in this field. The researchers will be able to understand the internal details of parameters and techniques used in the fraud detection systems. This literature also helps the research to think in a variety of ways that how these parameters will be used in the development of fraud detection system.   Originality/value This paper is one of the most comprehensive reviews in its field. It tries and attempts to fill a void created because of lack of compilation of the laid fraud detection parameters.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-03-2017-0024?af=R","2018-11-22 14:22:39","32","Journal of Financial Crime"

Design/methodology/approach The research is based on primary and secondary resources; especially, the paper critically examines the central piece of legislation relevant to WT and analyses and compares a number of important judicial decisions of India.   Findings Despite some limitations, the judicial initiatives reflect an impressive progression towards WT, and given the contemporary commercial imperatives backed up by technological advances, the interconnectedness of economies and global corporisation, such a progression is indispensable.   Research limitations/implications The research involves only the legal aspects of WT; therefore, the social and economic implication is beyond the scope of it.   Practical implications Even though the legal and judicial attempts in India have raised an inevitable tension between different competing claims and are in some instances intensely debated, a review of existing resources evidences a series of effective methods and practices where a balance can sensibly be drawn between those claims.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-05-2017-0040?af=R","2018-11-22 14:22:39","28","Journal of Financial Crime"
"13681","Hedge Fund Manager Fraud Through Pipes","Journal of Financial Crime, Volume 25, Issue 3, Page 636-645, July 2018. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose The purpose of this paper is to draw lessons to investors from the conduct of a hedge fund manager who according to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) complaint made false and misleading statements before and after an auditorâ€™s reports, misappropriated for personal benefit over $1m, misappropriated clientsâ€™ assets, failed to conduct due diligence on third-party buyer, instructed an employee to mislead investors and satisfied some investorsâ€™ redemptions with other investorsâ€™ subscriptions (Ponzi scheme) without disclosing it to investors. Ironically, the scheme was unveiled by the economic crises and not the investors, their advisers or third-party hedge fund vendors. Corey Ribotsky set up the investment adviser NIR Group to manage four AJW Funds that invested in private equity in public companies in 1999. Through manipulation of financial statements, he also managed to collect about $136m in management and incentive fees over an eight-year period. The SEC complaint alleged the AJW Fundsâ€™ assets to be $876m in 2007, yet this figure was not verified, and no assets were traced. Ribotsky did not pay any monies to SEC, as ordered by court settlement, and hence the victims did not recover any of their monies. The SEC could not produce criminal charges; hence, Ribotsky did not go to jail. This case highlights sterility of law enforcement when confronted with brazen fraud.   Findings Investors fail to monitor hedge fund managers. Fraud was detected late and not through investors. Fraud was unraveled by the economic crises of 2008. The SEC had sued the fund manager. The fund manager consented to making payment to the SEC but did not make any payments. The SEC could not bring evidence to criminally charge the fund manager.   Research limitations/implications The findings based on the case study are valuable to investors and hedge fund industry stakeholders. The findings are not based on an empirical study.   Practical implications Investors need to carefully vet all hedge fund managers before allocating and funds and understand how managers make money through the claimed strategy. Also, there are limitations to law enforcement even with confronted with profound fraud schemes.   Originality/value The case was built up from public sources to benefit investors considering making allocations to hedge fund managers. The public information about the case is of either legalistic or journalistic in nature.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-04-2017-0032?af=R","2018-11-22 14:22:39","33","Journal of Financial Crime"

Design/methodology/approach The research uses a comparative approach by examining the existing legislations on a global, European and Italian level for finding analogies and differences between them.   Findings The research has discovered a wide variation in the legislative interventions against economic crimes and in the kind of imposed sanctions. Nevertheless, there seems to be a trend toward penalties, with a high degree of uniformity between the different levels of protection.   Research limitations/implications This paper aims to maintain a common international level in fighting against economic crime and to enforce the effectiveness of national regulations.   Practical implications The achievement of a high level of protection, for public security and social cohesion to prevent and reduce economic crimes.   Social implications This paper ensures a high level of security for the general public by taking action against money laundering, cybercrimes and other sorts of misconduct, as well as by intensifying preventive action against all kinds of economic crime through an effective global cooperation.   Originality/value This is a fast-moving area of law, which continues to evolve for the variety of behaviors through which economic crime occurs, so different solutions to the problem can be found by national legislators who must be coordinated in a global context on the basis of an international standard of protection to which they more and more frequently have to conform their own rules.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-10-2017-0098?af=R","2018-11-22 14:22:39","28","Journal of Financial Crime"
"13683","Tax-Related Illicit Financial Flows and Human Rights","Journal of Financial Crime, Volume 25, Issue 3, Page 750-769, July 2018. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose This paper aims to discuss the tax-related illicit financial flows from a human rights perspective. It argues that curbing illicit financial flows, and specifically tax abuse, is essential not only for realizing human rights but also for achieving the sustainable development goals. It provides definitions of tax evasion and avoidance, as well as estimations of illicit financial flows. It studies the tax abuse implications for human rights and sustainable development, as well as the obligations in the field of human rights and tax abuse. It also critically assesses the recent international initiatives aim at curbing illicit financial flows. It concludes with a set of recommendations on how to curb illicit financial flows.   Design/methodology/approach This paper combines economic, legal and policy perspectives to study the multidimensional, complex and global problem of illicit financial flows. It not only proposes an explanation of the volume, roots and economic, social and human rights implications of illicit financial flows but it also proposes reforms that states and other stakeholders need to implement in order to curb this phenomenon.   Findings Combating tax abuse and illicit financial flows more broadly, is essential to make better progress in realizing international human rights obligations. The inclusion of a specific target to reduce illicit financial flows under the sustainable development goals makes clear that curbing such flows is also essential for creating an enabling environment for sustainable development. While we should applaud that reducing illicit financial flows is mentioned in one of the targets of the sustainable development goals, the target remains broad and vague. Specific measures to operationalize this target are needed to ensure that progress is achieved and that such progress can be tracked and measured. The author presents recommendations for discussion. To promote accountability, the recommendations are addressed to specific stakeholders.   Originality/value This paper tries to contribute to improve our knowledge and understanding of illicit financial flows and tax abuse more specifically at global level and their implications for human rights, to make the need for change more compelling, as well as to stimulate the debate around reforms that need to be implemented to curb illicit financial flows.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-04-2017-0029?af=R","2018-11-22 14:22:39","51","Journal of Financial Crime"
"13684","Tbml Suspicious Activity Reports â€“ A Financial Intelligence Unit Perspective","Journal of Financial Crime, Volume 25, Issue 3, Page 721-733, July 2018. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose The purpose of this paper is to share research data from the Financial Intelligence sector on trade-based money laundering (TBML), as a way to better inform banking risk assessment and the submission of suspicious activity reports (SARs).   Design/methodology/approach The research data formed part of a bigger project on TBML banking risk assessment for improving the detection of TBML activity. This paper analysed the data from an online survey carried out among the financial intelligence staff from financial intelligence units (FIUs) and some external financial intelligence agencies. The aim was to determine which areas of banking SARs needed to be improved or enhanced to support FIU investigations.   Findings The research found that FIUs do use the data supplied to them, in particular the SARs. The research also found that more data would be appreciated from banks especially in relation to beneficial ownership information and politically exposed persons data. The findings highlighted that contact between banks and FIUs was limited and restricted to a couple of key individuals, whereas the increased requirement for intelligence and more data would suggest that this relationship needs to be expanded and strengthened.   Research limitations/implications The main limitation was the restricted scope of the survey (only focussed on TBML) and was broad in depth, and perhaps a local FIU survey would be useful to look at specific country recommendations. Similar research also needs to be conducted on other forms of ML activity. The research identified the need for more information on beneficial ownership information; however, other work needs to be done on how exactly banks can access this data.   Practical implications The main outcome from the research was the need for SARs to contain more detailed information on beneficial ownership and politically exposed persons data. This needs to be incorporated into a specific risk assessment tool for TBML that considers not only the client but also relevant business partners and silent partners/shell companies used by the client. This research is part of a bigger research project that has developed a risk matrix tool for TBML and can be linked into this work.   Originality/value The paper used original data collected by the researcher from 49 FIU and financial intelligence staff across the globe. The timely presentation of the results and the nature of the sample means that this is relevant and useful data to be presented to the banking sector.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-10-2016-0064?af=R","2018-11-22 14:22:39","33","Journal of Financial Crime"
"13685","Does Fear of Victimization Deter Online Shopping?","Journal of Financial Crime, Volume 25, Issue 3, Page 770-783, July 2018. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose This paper aims to address the relationship between fear of identity theft/fraud and online shopping, while identifying the most important factors affecting online shopping.   Design/methodology/approach This study uses a mixed method approach in which the quantitative analysis identifies patterns in the data, whereas the qualitative analysis offers in-depth interpretation.   Findings More fear actually predicts more online shopping but shoppersâ€™ trust in the websiteâ€™s willingness to redress financial harm and risk-benefit analysis are the real factors in online shopping.   Research limitations/implications The sample consists of Amazon users mostly so the findings may not apply to those who never shop on Amazon or never shop online at all.   Practical implications To encourage online shopping, online shopping websites should focus on maximizing the benefit and minimizing the risk, but without addressing the risk by reassuring shoppers of their financial security, emphasizing the benefit alone is ineffective.   Originality/value This is the first study addressing online shopping in terms of fear of victimization. It is also the first study that addresses risk and benefit in relative terms as in risk-benefit analysis measured by both quantitative and qualitative methods.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-05-2017-0038?af=R","2018-11-22 14:22:39","41","Journal of Financial Crime"
"13686","What Made Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project Possible?","Journal of Financial Crime, Volume 25, Issue 3, Page 795-810, July 2018. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose The purpose of this paper is to unveil the true background of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Project and to suggest crucial indexes for bringing a movement into a future ceiling causing a struggle of the international tax system.   Design/methodology/approach This paper looks into the historical context of this project before and after Starbucksâ€™ scandal, comparing to other contexts of the international tax system. Also, this paper partially reviews BEPS from a legal perspective.   Findings The key factors for building momentum of reform of international taxation are a country having a government willing to embrace the cause of reform, unfairness felt toward entities using tax avoidance schemes which other comparable entities could not be use, grass-roots pressure for the reform, effective places to negotiate cooperation among major countries for the reform, solid cooperation among many countries in the world to implement standards and rhetoric of slogan with less opposition.   Originality/value The momentum of the reform of international taxation was analyzed before. But the BEPS Project has involved some unique events as compared with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Developmentâ€™s project on harmful tax practices, such as initiation of NGOs and boycott by consumers. Additionally, this paper will discuss insights, which the former research did not do.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-08-2017-0072?af=R","2018-11-22 14:22:39","27","Journal of Financial Crime"
"13687","The Gendering of Fraud: An International Investigation","Journal of Financial Crime, Volume 25, Issue 3, Page 811-837, July 2018. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose Changing workplace demographics reflect a rising number of women in the traditionally male-dominated field of business. The purpose of this study is to investigate how upwardly mobile women may impact the commission and type of white-collar crime, contributing to the scarce literature on gender distinctions in criminal behavior while comparing criminal trends globally. Womenâ€™s increased representation in positions of power in business provides them with increased fraud opportunities prompting the authors to ask: in their areas of opportunity, do women and men commit the same types of white-collar crime and at the same rates, and how does this phenomena vary globally?   Design/methodology/approach Using a database from the Institute for Fraud Prevention, 5,441 fraud cases are examined from 93 nations for the annual periods from 2002 until 2011. Ordinal logistic regression methods are used to test for differences in gendered criminal behavior by fraud offense type controlling for age, position, education, compensation level and country context.   Findings Internationally, results from the study indicate that female fraudsters are three times more likely than male fraudsters to commission crimes of asset misappropriation in the workplace. Upon further investigation, stratifying the data by geographical region, findings from the study demonstrate that female fraudsters are more likely than male fraudsters to commit asset misappropriation in the following geographical regions: Africa (three times as likely), Asia (twice as likely), Canada (three times as likely), China (five times as likely), Europe (twice as likely), the Middle East (four times as likely), Oceania (four times as likely), the United Kingdom (eight times as likely) and the United States of America (twice as likely).   Originality/value Evidence from this study should be of importance to multinational enterprises, auditors and fraud examiners, as asset misappropriation constitutes 87 per cent of all fraud cases globally. Further, these findings prompt the need for researchers to develop this area of research.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-08-2017-0074?af=R","2018-11-22 14:22:39","83","Journal of Financial Crime"

Design/methodology/approach Guided by Corporate Integrity System Malaysia, this study developed and collected 101-questionnaire survey from Royal Custom officers.   Findings The findings revealed that individual factors (religiosity and ethical values) significantly contribute to fraud reduction, and organizational factors (both ethical leadership and whistle blowing practices) do not significantly contribute to employee fraud mitigation.   Originality/value This study serves as a useful guide to alert and educate employers, professionals, law enforcement officers and policymakers of the importance of individual and organizational factors in mitigating employee fraud. There is very little empirical research conducted on employee fraud in Malaysia. This research helps bring that to light.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-09-2017-0087?af=R","2018-11-22 14:22:39","29","Journal of Financial Crime"

In particular, the paper argues that the components of cognitive interview make it useful for financial crime investigators to gather and collate information on financial criminality.   Design/methodology/approach The paper chronicles the literature on cognitive interviews to critically evaluate its usefulness in previous studies.   Findings A critical examination of the literature shows that cognitive interviews were successfully used in a variety of circumstances. Despite its difficulties, the empirical evidence reveals that cognitive interview fared well in laboratory studies across different (and vulnerable) population groups.   Practical implications There is evidence to suggest that cognitive interviews can be an effective technique to interview witnesses of financial crimes. The fact that white-collar criminals, more often than not, comes from a â€œgentleman backgroundâ€ and are not accustomed to the role of â€œcriminal suspect,â€ makes cognitive interview techniques a useful tool for fraud investigators.   Originality/value To the authorâ€™s knowledge, this is the first paper of its kind to conduct a thorough literature review and apply cognitive interview techniques to financial crime investigation.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-09-2017-0084?af=R","2018-11-22 14:22:39","32","Journal of Financial Crime"
"13690","Kleptocracy and Foreign Corruption Manifesting in Illicit Financial Flows","Journal of Financial Crime, Volume 25, Issue 3, Page 681-701, July 2018. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose The purpose of this paper is to identify the place of kleptocracy and foreign corruption within the broader framework of financial crime. This facilitates understanding the importance of kleptocracy and foreign corruption as social problems. Two other aims are to better understand the most problematic components of a kleptocratic network and the most effective combatants of that network. A subsequent goal is to offer solutions from a broad range of interventions, including policy, technology, education, research and collaborative efforts.   Design/methodology/approach Theoretical economic concepts are used to analyze the importance of kleptocracy and foreign corruption. A small in-depth survey of 15 experts is conducted to identify the most problematic components of kleptocratic networks and the most effective combatants of those networks. The proposed solutions are based on a combination of argumentation, econometric developments, application of trends in related fields and material from in-depth surveys.   Findings This paper identifies kleptocracy and foreign corruption as one of the most, if not the most, devastating financial crime according to its impact on the total marginal utility of wealth. Experts identify foreign kleptocrats or corrupt foreign government officials as the most problematic entities in kleptocratic networks and the most effective combatant is identified as the US Department of Justice. By adding up fines and asset forfeiture related to corruption, penalties are found to be a small fraction of the problem in terms of monetary magnitude.   Research limitations/implications The paper does not attempt to make causal claims because of the nature of the paperâ€™s purpose and methodology.   Practical implications The paper offers suggestions and methods for academic researchers who may wish to pursue a research agenda that is empirical and forensic with the aim of combatting kleptocracy and foreign corruption. The paper describes how information on kleptocracy and foreign corruption can be implemented into business and economics curriculum.   Social implications Kleptocracy and foreign corruption are important problems, and creative solutions are desperately needed.   Originality/value The paper shows how understanding and combatting kleptocracy and foreign corruption can be considered an interdisciplinary activity, touching on fields including technology, economics, business, ethics, education, law, policy, statistics and research methods.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-02-2017-0008?af=R","2018-11-22 14:22:39","55","Journal of Financial Crime"

In particular, the authors investigate the understanding of SME owners and managers on fraud schemes and the usage of antifraud measures.   Design/methodology/approach A sample of 126 Malaysian SMEs from different industries participated in this study.   Findings The results suggest that Malaysian SMEs are exposed to a broad range of fraud schemes, yet few take actions to prevent these frauds.   Practical implications The findings should be useful to academic researchers, entrepreneurs, regulators and others who are interested in understanding the fraud risk in small businesses.   Originality/value This study extends and contributes to prior literature by linking the state of fraud and SMEs in developing countries.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-08-2017-0077?af=R","2018-11-22 14:22:39","30","Journal of Financial Crime"
"13692","Crime Prevention in Terms of Criminal Intent Criteria in White-Collar Crime","Journal of Financial Crime, Volume 25, Issue 3, Page 838-844, July 2018. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose In the field of crime prevention there are several theoretical approaches explaining why crime occurs and how to prevent it. Three of them â€“ routine activity theory, crime pattern theory and the theory of crime-as-choice â€“ are logically tested in this work. The point of departure is to test if the theories are logical consistent and logical valid, irrespective of whether the criterion for criminal intent is changed from direct intention to negligence.   Design/methodology/approach The issues will be explored in a logical structure by a first-order logic propositional analysis.   Findings The analysis shows that all three theories are logical consistent, but only routine activity theory is logical valid. The conclusion is that crime prevention should in general assume that routine activity theory is the legitimate theory and that social prevention as a prevention strategy is logically unnecessary to adopt because it does not matter whether the offender is motivated (direct intention) or not (negligence).   Practical implications It does not really matter if the authors theoretically treat white-collar offenders as motivated, because if they have committed an actus reus, they are an offender according to the objective requisites. This means that the best strategies to prevent a potential white-collar criminal are situational prevention, i.e. complicate their access to money, where it becomes irrelevant if the potential offender has a mens rea or not. What counts is the prevention of actus reus by a potential offender.   Originality/value As far as I know, no one has previously investigated the logical consistency and/or logical validity of routine activity theory, crime pattern theory and the theory of crime-as-choice as theories of crime prevention.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-05-2017-0051?af=R","2018-11-22 14:22:39","44","Journal of Financial Crime"
"13693","Internal Control and Employeesâ€™ Occupational Fraud on Expenditure Claims","Journal of Financial Crime, Volume 25, Issue 3, Page 891-906, July 2018. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose The purpose of this study is to investigate the weaknesses of internal control in expenditure claim procedure and to identify the opinions of employees regarding an occupational fraud. This study also attempts to examine the most popular occupational fraud committed by the employee and whether a companyâ€™s working environment contributed to the fraud.   Design/methodology/approach A case study approach was adopted to investigate and analyse the weaknesses of the internal control and occupational fraud incidents. A mixed method of data collection, specifically, survey questionnaire and document analysis were used.   Findings This study found that the internal control of the expenditure claim procedure was weak and needed improvement. This study also found that a strong internal control and a better remuneration paid to the employees could reduce the risk of the occupational fraud committed in the company. In terms of fraud types, this study discovered that claims on mileage, followed by petrol, accommodation and suppliersâ€™ invoice were the most popular occupational frauds committed by the employees. Finally, employee dissatisfaction and poor working-environment culture influence occupational fraudâ€™s level in the organizations.   Research limitations/implications The results provide further confirmation of the fraud triangle theory on the causes of fraud, i.e. opportunity because of a weak internal control and financial pressure because of low and non-standardized salary. This study, however, was conducted only on one company.   Practical implications This study provides some recommendations to overcome the weak internal control and improve employeesâ€™ satisfaction which lead to better working environment. Thus, opportunities for fraud in the company can be reduced.   Originality/value This study is original, as it focusses specifically on occupational fraud which is rare in fraud literature, particularly for a study that is conducted in developing markets like Malaysia. It also has examined various related sensitive documents and reports of employee frauds that are generally difficult to be accessed by researchers.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-07-2017-0067?af=R","2018-11-22 14:22:39","47","Journal of Financial Crime"
"13694","The Battle Against Fraud: Do Reporting Mechanisms Work?","Journal of Financial Crime, Volume 25, Issue 3, Page 784-794, July 2018. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose This paper aims to explore how well reporting mechanisms work, investigate current trends and develop a framework for implementing effective mechanisms.   Design/methodology/approach This study is based on primary and secondary data, criminology theory and best corporate strategies.   Findings This study shows that the median number of annual reports equals 1.2 per cent of the number of employees in an organization and that 40 per cent of these reports have merit (Navex Global, 2014). In addition, 42.2 per cent of all frauds are detected through internal reports, whatever their form. Organizations with formal reporting mechanisms sustain fraud losses that are 40.5 per cent less than other organizations (ACFE, 2014). Moreover, employees are more willing to report theft, human resource and workplace issues than fraud and corruption, while 21 per cent of all whistleblowers have experienced some form of retaliation for reporting wrongdoing (Ethics Resource Center, 2014). Results from primary data show that the option to remain anonymous is offered only by 74 per cent of all reporting mechanisms. This paper argues that effective reporting mechanisms should actively encourage whistleblowing, that all credible allegations should be independently investigated and that whistleblowers should be offered the option to remain anonymous. The oversight and the daily administration of reporting mechanisms should be given to two different parties who are independent from management and who do not participate in incentive compensation plans (Lipman, 2012).   Research limitations/implications This paper extends previous research by reporting on current hotline trends and integrating various factors into a framework to implement effective reporting mechanisms.   Originality/value It is the first paper to investigate the effectiveness of reporting mechanisms and current policy trends.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-05-2017-0048?af=R","2018-11-22 14:22:39","41","Journal of Financial Crime"

The objectives of this study are threefold â€“ to measure the financial strength, to measure integrity index and to examine the relationship between management practices and financial strength.   Design/methodology/approach Financial ratios, Altmanâ€™s Z-Score, integrity index, ranking approach and chi-square test are used to achieve the objectives. A multi-year cross-country analysis is done by considering sample of seven Asian countries, namely, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, Hong Kong, China and Japan.   Findings The study catches the relationship between management practices and financial strength across sample countries. Management practices is one of the responsible factors for this relationship. They use discretionary power in preparing financial statements to control the trading results. The principles of accounting do not support the alteration of financial data to look the company better on paper. The cost of financial statement fraud is higher than other occupational fraud.   Research limitations/implications This study does not cover factors other than management practices and further study could be conducted to look for the other reasons that may also responsible for the deviations.   Practical implications Conflict of interest between shareholders and board of directors is not a new phenomenon. Auditing system is introduced to minimize this conflict of interest, but they failed to uphold their position in reality. Management also needs to prove their integrity in financial statements. Ethical consideration is the highest priority.   Social implications Stakeholders, especially regulators, professional bodies and academics, should concentrate on the issue on â€˜how to reduce the manipulation in financial statementsâ€™ to create a safe investments avenue for the nation.   Originality/value This study provides empirical evidences regarding the influence of management practices on financial statements and financial strength of listed companies across countries. The culture, attitudes, beliefs, perceptions, etc., are different from country to country. The aim is to contribute empirical evidence about the relationship between management practices and financial health in different settings.

Design/methodology/approach Data were gathered through in-depth interviews, non-participatory observations and documentary analysis.   Findings The results of the integrative analysis show that the EFCC has apparently been ineffective, and further improvization of the organization is needed. Poor performance of the EFCC was associated with factors such as lack of commitment, inefficient judiciary, insufficient budgets and incompetent personnel.   Practical implications This study recommends further improvements in the form of a greater political will, improved legal process and also elevated budgetary funds and recruitment of personnel to the EFCC.   Originality/value The study adopted a descriptive, qualitative case study approach to describe the current state of the EFCC in Nigeria.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-01-2017-0003?af=R","2018-11-22 14:22:39","44","Journal of Financial Crime"

Design/methodology/approach Data are derived from Transparency International and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and tested on the countries China, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Russia, Spain and the UK and are analysed with a natural log (LN) regression model.   Findings The findings indicate a negative asymmetric relationship for China, Germany, Korea, Spain and Russia. This means that negative performance on CD will not have greater impact on FDI outflows than positive performance on CD in the same country. Loss aversion, as well as diminishing sensitivity, as suggested by the PT, cannot be supported with the empirical results.   Originality/value Its originality lies in contributing and extending knowledge on CD on FDI in several ways. First, it analyses the data of emerging and industrialized countries, namely, Russia, China, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Spain and the UK. Second, a potential asymmetric impact is explained by the characteristics of the hypothetical value function of the PT. Third, it seeks empirical evidence by applying an econometric model developed to analyse the variables CD and FDI.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-09-2017-0078?af=R","2018-11-22 14:22:39","52","Journal of Financial Crime"

                  <p>Persons employed in highly stressful occupations are at a heightened risk for developing chronic stress-related disorders. These disorders are associated with immunosuppression, disease progression and psychological illness. Exercise has previously been used to combat depression; however, police personnel are already moderately active yet still stressed. Therefore, this pilot study aims to determine if high-intensity intermittent training (HIIT) could be a potential stress-reducing strategy in already trained persons, and which biological markers could be measured in a larger study. Using three single case studies, this study employed a 10-week HIIT intervention and measured markers of stress via Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) scores, cortisol levels and associated inflammation blood markers at baseline and post-intervention. The PSS scores reduced after HIIT (36&ndash;40%). Cortisol secretion pre-intervention indicated a flat profile during daytime hours; post-intervention showed increased levels in the morning and an overall normal daytime profile. Of the inflammation blood markers, eosinophil cell counts were halved post-intervention. HIIT, therefore, is a potential stress-reducing strategy in already trained individuals. The decreased psychological stress was associated with normalization of cortisol hormone function and reduced systemic inflammation via lower eosinophil counts, which highlighted the specific physiological markers as indicators of chronic stress.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9303-z","2018-11-23 10:23:52","50","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"

                  <p>Evidence shows that waste crimes, principally trafficking, are facilitated by unclear regulatory frameworks. Indeed, lax legislation can unintentionally generate crime opportunities. The aim of this study is to combine criminological and legal knowledge to identify loopholes in the waste regulatory frameworks of the European Union and Italian government. A crime proofing analysis was conducted to identify vulnerabilities in the selected waste legislation. Results indicate the existence of three macrocategories of loopholes: the legal framework, the supply chain, and the justice response system. Policy implications involve the necessity to simplify the language in waste legislation, to create effective measures via which to improve the traceability of waste, and to provide law enforcement authorities with adequate training and technological resources to perform inspection activities.

                  <p>This project examines the relationship between police enforcement of driving under the influence (DUI) and fatal alcohol related crashes. This article merged data from several sources to fit several 3-level growth curve models that assess the relationship between DUI arrests and fatal alcohol related crashes in U.S. counties from 1985 to 2015. The findings indicate that increases in DUI arrests are related to decreased fatal alcohol related crashes during the period. However, the two are not linearly related and the relationship varies across states. The non-linearity indicates there is a point of diminished returns where increased arrests are no longer related to reductions in fatalities. These findings suggest that policy makers should explore alternative methods of reducing crashes to supplement enforcement efforts such as addressing problems of alcoholism and traffic safety.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12103-018-9464-4","2018-11-24 03:23:31","51","American Journal of Criminal Justice"
"13720","The Effect of Outpatient Methadone Maintenance Treatment Facilities on Place-Based Crime","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Objectives</h3>
                    <p>This study evaluates the effect of outpatient methadone maintenance treatment (OMMT) facilities on crime in surrounding areas.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>Between 2007 and 2017 in Philadelphia, three OMMT facilities closed, and six new OMMT facilities opened. The variation in OMMT facility presence at these nine locations provides an opportunity to estimate the place-based effect of OMMT facilities on crime. We use Poisson regression to estimate the percentage change in crime relative to OMMT facility proximity. We also compare those effects relative to crime trends around OMMT facilities that were continuously open throughout the study period.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>Within a 200 m radius, the presence of an OMMT facility causes a significant decrease in property and total crime but a significant increase in drug and violent crime. There are no significant effects on crime outside of the 200-m radius. The effects of an OMMT facility on property, violent, and total crime decrease with increasing distance from the OMMT facility, consistent with a causal effect.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>OMMT facilities appear to influence crime in their surroundings. The areas around OMMT facilities experience reduced total crime and property crime; nonetheless, these areas might benefit from further assessment of violent crime risk.</p>

                  <p>Ongoing internal conflict, high gender inequality, and a patriarchal society contribute to a high prevalence of intimate partner violence towards women (IPV) in Afghanistan. Seeking help from formal and informal sources can provide social support to IPV survivors, buffering negative health consequences. The purpose of this study is to examine the individual, interpersonal, and community-level factors associated with help-seeking for physical, sexual, and emotional IPV in Afghanistan using a nationally-representative sample of women aged 15&ndash;49. Data for this analysis comes from the 2015 Afghanistan Demographic and Health Survey. The outcome variable is a binary measure of informal or formal help-seeking behavior among women who reported physical, sexual, or emotional IPV in the last 12&nbsp;months. Drawing on existing theory of help-seeking for IPV, key covariates included summative indices of health care use, decision-making power, and barriers to accessing health care measured at both the individual and community levels using multilevel modeling. Nearly half (46%) of women in the dataset reported experiencing some type of IPV in the past 12&nbsp;months. Among the 20% of women who reported seeking help for IPV, informal sources of support were used almost universally. Engagement with the health care system, barriers to accessing health care, and decision-making power were all significantly associated with seeking help for IPV. IPV is widespread in Afghanistan and help-seeking is uncommon. A better understanding of what shapes help-seeking in this context may allow more women to disclose violence, increasing social support and reducing the negative health effects of IPV.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-0024-y","2018-11-26 12:25:12","27","Journal of Family Violence"

                  <span>
                    <h3>Research Question</h3>
                    <p>To what extent do people classified by police as &lsquo;offenders&rsquo; and those they classify as &lsquo;victims&rsquo; overlap, thus creating a third category of individual targets for crime and harm reduction called &lsquo;victim-offenders&rsquo;?</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Data</h3>
                    <p>Leicestershire police records in the 3-year period 2014&ndash;2016 were compiled on all 117,766 individuals who were identified as either victims or offenders in all 159,702 crimes in which one or more individual victims were named. A 730-day-at-risk tracking period after individuals&rsquo; initial appearance in the data set was examined for the tracked cohort of 42,916 individuals who entered the data set in 2014 only and were ultimately identified in 62,336 individual-victim crimes.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>Each individual who entered the data set from 2014 to 2016 was classified as (only) a victim, (only) an offender, or (both) victim and offender in separate events. We designate the latter category as victim-offenders. The total count of criminal events and total recommended days of imprisonment value of the Cambridge Crime Harm Index (CHI) were calculated for each individual, both for crimes committed and victimizations experienced. Individuals who entered the data set in 2014 were tracked for 730&nbsp;days from their first recorded offence or victimization. All individuals were ranked, by both crime counts and CHI values, from highest to lowest.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Findings</h3>
                    <p>From 2014 to 2016, victims comprised 89.9% of the 117,766 individuals ever appearing as victims or offenders, offenders comprised 7.9% and victim-offenders were 3.2%. In 2014, all 38,318 individual victims and 4598 offenders were placed into the 730-day tracking period in which 1825 individuals became victim-offenders, or 4.2%. Initial offenders were seven times as likely to become victims (17.9%) as initial victims were to become offenders (2.6%). Victim-offenders had 74.5% higher average harm scores and 68% higher average crime counts than the overall 2014 entry cohort, with 65% of victim-offenders&rsquo; harm a result of their victimisation. Only 417 &lsquo;high harm-high volume&rsquo; individuals experience or cause the most crime harm as well as the most crime, of whom 49.9% (208/417) are victim-offenders, 33.3% (139/417) victims and 16.7% (70/417) offenders.</p>

                    <h3>Objectives</h3>
                    <p>A central issue in experiments is protecting the integrity of causal identification from treatment spillover effects. The objective of this article is to demonstrate a bright line beyond which spillover of treatment renders experimental results misleading. We focus on a highly publicized recent test of police body cameras that violated the key assumption of a valid experiment: independence of treatment conditions for each unit of analysis.</p>

                    <h3>Methods</h3>

                  <p>There are substantive differences in international preferences in the medium through which eyewitness identification lineups are administered, but these jurisdictional preferences are not based on evidence. Regardless of whether one medium produces greater identification accuracy, it is the perception of evidence strength by triers of fact that determines its influence in judicial proceedings. Yet, we know little about how lineup mediums are perceived by potential triers of fact. Four-hundred six undergraduate students viewed a video interview of an eyewitness describing an identification that took place with one of three different lineup mediums (live, video, photo) to compare their relative persuasiveness. Participants also directly compared mediums. There was a clear preference for evidence elicited from live lineups in direct comparisons, but not in the experimental conditions. Live lineup superiority beliefs exist in policy and, these data show, in the beliefs of potential witnesses and triers of fact when various lineup mediums are directly compared.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9305-x","2018-11-27 09:10:40","47","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"

Access to social services is a human rights issue that must be acted upon by state and federal officials. The law, however, requires approval of the T-Visa for receipt of benefits. Along with the T-visa application process, the applicant (human trafficking survivor) must be willing to assist in every reasonable way in the investigation and prosecution of the trafficker. The authors argue that drug dependency treatment and other social service benefits should be a separate issue and not dependent upon the T-visa and cooperation with the investigation and prosecution of the trafficker.</p>","https://digitalcommons.uri.edu/dignity/vol3/iss3/8","2018-11-27 09:24:28","37","Dignity: A Journal on Sexual Exploitation and Violence"
"13751","Criminogenic Policy As A Crime of the Powerful: A Case Study on Naftaâ€™s Negotiation Process","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>State-corporate crime frameworks have typically been applied to crimes committed by a single state. In a globalizing world, multiple states are more likely than ever before to commit crime in collusion as evinced in the growing crimes of the powerful literature. Studying international policy formation offers one unique avenue for investigating social harms that may arise from policy or its consequential conditions. Using traditional state-corporate crime frameworks (Kramer and Michalowski in Michalowski, Kramer (eds.) State-corporate crime: wrongdoing at the intersection of business and government, Rutgers University Press, New Brunswick, <span>2006</span>; Rothe and Mullins in Int J Comp Appl Crim Justice 33(1):97&ndash;118, <span>2009</span>), the current research applies these frameworks to international policy formation by focusing on overlapping motivations, opportunities, and lax controls and constraints by multiple states, corporations, and other organizations involved in policy formation. Furthermore, the concept of a transnational capitalist class is integrated with this framework to better understand the connections between elites influencing policy. To demonstrate this novel approach, the current research is a case study of NAFTA&rsquo;s negotiation process. It is argued that NAFTA was a criminogenic policy&mdash;an agreement that created conditions conducive for social harm&mdash;evinced by a North American transnational class that colluded to create a policy favorable to their motivations while neglecting, censoring, or even oppressing the opposition. The result was an exclusionary policy capable of producing social harm. Future criminologists should seek ways to detect criminogenic policies during formation and implement safeguards against them, and the current renegotiation of NAFTA is one place to start.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10612-018-9425-8","2018-11-27 10:22:11","36","Critical Criminology"

"13765","The Relative Influence of Legal Pressure on Outcomes in A Rehabilitation Aftercare Drug Court","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>The concept of legal pressure has been used in research to study the effect threats of increased punishment have on the rehabilitation trajectory of individuals with substance use disorders under community supervision. This study investigates how unequal legal pressures affect the chances of success for participants in a drug court-supervised rehabilitation aftercare program. Using bivariate and logistic regression analyses, we compare the successful program completion rates of individuals charged with felony- and misdemeanor-level offenses. Consistent with the legal pressure thesis, we find that clients under misdemeanor-level charges become more likely to fail probation than those under the threat of felony-level punishment upon transition to community aftercare. Moreover, the higher rate of failure in the lower legal pressure group is strongly associated with their failure to abstain from drug use during the outpatient phase of community supervision. A shift in legal pressure is thus identified as a potential dynamic risk factor in substance abuse aftercare. The implications for community supervision of offenders recovering from addictions are discussed.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12103-018-9465-3","2018-11-28 22:08:02","55","American Journal of Criminal Justice"

                  <p>Over the past two decades, criminologists have attempted to better understand the process through which research is used by practitioners and policymakers to identify the conditions that facilitate its policy and practice use. As part of this effort, the current study examines the translational research process and the use of researcher-practitioner partnerships (RPPs) in two state correctional agencies. The methods include interviews with leading national researchers, Florida legislative personnel, and state-level decision makers in adult and juvenile corrections. The findings document barriers, facilitators, and mechanisms involved in the translation process and reveal the effectiveness of RPPs to translate research into policy and practice.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12103-018-9467-1","2018-11-29 19:22:08","53","American Journal of Criminal Justice"

It also notes that implementation may have been influenced by institutional changes and related emerging governmental policy agendas and institutional changes relating to organised crime, terrorism and cybercrime.   Design/methodology/approach The research for the paper was undertaken by desk reviews of primary and secondary material. The paper also involved face-to-face interviews with personnel from the regional fraud unit and the three North-east police forcesâ€™ fraud units. The interviews were semi-structured and were conducted on grounds of anonymity for the personnel and the forces involved, with a focus on trends and issues. The personnel were invited to comment on a draft of the paper in terms of accuracy of the information they provided; no revisions or additions were proposed. Interpretation of that information is the sole responsibility of the author.   Findings The paper finds that, despite the decade since the Fraud Review, issues of effectiveness or relevance of national fraud strategies, absence of incentives and identifiable benefits and continuous influence of competing agendas on police priorities continue to marginalise fraud as a mainstream police function and limit the level of resource committed to what also continues to be a rising area of criminality.   Research limitations/implications The research looks at the recommendations, strategies and consequential organisational and other changes at national, regional and local levels through implementation by four policing units in the North-east. It also notes that implementation may have been influenced by institutional changes and related emerging governmental policy agendas and institutional changes relating to organised crime, terrorism and cybercrime. While the research is limited in that, it draws on the experience of three local and one regional fraud unit; its findings support further research about the implementation of strategies and agendas in practice on the ground.   Practical implications The research validates many of the findings by Her Majestyâ€™s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) and supports the need to review national strategies to ensure effective implementation at local level for what also continues to be a rising area of criminality.   Social implications The research raises important issues concerning public concern over fraud where majority of frauds are of high volume, low value with low levels of recovery and usually targeted at individuals but where the policing responses are targeted elsewhere.   Originality/value The research is the first study on the local implementation of national strategies on fraud and raises positive and less positive aspects of how far national strategies and intentions are addressed on the ground.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-04-2017-0027?af=R","2018-11-30 10:37:06","47","Journal of Financial Crime"

Design/methodology/approach The research is explanatory, descriptive and exploratory, relying extensively on existing anti-graft journals, text books, decided cases, constitutional provisions, statutory provisions and United Nation Conventions.   Findings The research findings and analysis propose that the existing financial crime control measures in developing nations fail to consider local customs and circumstances in formulating anti-corruption policies and laws; consequently, a meaningful and effective financial crime control in developing nations, especially in Nigeria, requires the customs and culture to be examined and evaluated with a view to designing a pragmatic policies and laws.   Originality/value The paper contributes practical options to observed lapses in the existing financial control laws, especially corruption. The paper will be valuable to African Governments, corporations and the academic community.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-09-2017-0083?af=R","2018-11-30 10:37:06","27","Journal of Financial Crime"

Findings A performance matrix could be used to incentivize both compliance and productivity.   Research limitations/implications This studyâ€™s findings are limited to the perspectives of 20 interviewees. Hence, it is possible that a study with a larger sample conducted in different countries or at a different time would have led to different results.   Practical implications The identification of gaps in existing anti-bribery compliance mechanisms is meant to provide compliance officers and legislators with valuable insights into how undesirable behavior could be prevented.   Originality/value It is found that eliminating the wrong incentives and establishing the right ones could make significant strides in advancing the fight against bribery.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-09-2017-0081?af=R","2018-11-30 10:37:06","36","Journal of Financial Crime"

Design/methodology/approach This study utilizes a deeply rooted content analysis technique of corporate sustainability reporting, covering 66 Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) firms during 2014.   Findings Strengthened by the application of the institutional theory, insight into the results points to a state of limited maturity regarding the disclosure of anti-corruption procedures in the region. More specifically, the results highlight the compliance in the reporting of conduct code, while reporting information on whistleblowing was significantly less in comparison. Firms in Qatar and the UAE ultimately release better informed reports, inclusive of detailed information on internal anti-corruption practices.   Originality/value The aim of this study is to determine the extent of sustainability reporting in GCC companies under coercive isomorphism concept, with a special interest in the disclosure of anti-corruption practices. Ultimately, addressing the following questions: To what extent the GCC companies disclose their anti-corruption practices in the sustainability reports? What areas of anti-corruption disclosure the GCC is more concerned in their sustainability reports? To what extent do external forces under coercive isomorphism explain the extent of anti-corruption?","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-05-2017-0045?af=R","2018-11-30 10:37:06","38","Journal of Financial Crime"
"13816","Human Aspirations Or Human Rights?","Journal of Financial Crime, Volume 25, Issue 4, Page 1094-1104, October 2018. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose The purpose of this paper is to engender new thinking regarding the intersection between universal human rights and development, and associated programmes. This leads to three subsidiary objectives: demonstrating the mutually reinforcing relationship between human rights and development; considering the practical divide between having and exercising a right; understanding the impact of non-state actors; and emphasising the ways in which state capacity and social capabilities need to be enhanced to both transform the consideration of human rights into a meaningful development catalyst and treat development as a significant contributor to human rights endeavours.   Design/methodology/approach The paper begins by exploring the historical and contemporary understanding of the relationship between development and human rights â€“ arguing for the increasing recognition of their mutually reinforcing relationship. The second section analyses the controversy regarding the existence of genuine â€œuniversalâ€ human rights; followed by considering whether human rights are mere aspirations or genuine rights â€“ exposing the difficulty of monitoring, evaluating, and enforcing adherence to human rights mandates, particularly given the growth of non-state actors, such as multinational corporations (MNCs)/transnational corporations (TNCs). The paper closes with a call to strengthen social capabilities and state capacities to consolidate the union between development and human rights.   Findings Credence is broadly given to the moral argument for including human rights within a development framework. However, the economic argument remains largely neglected and certainly under-emphasized. Human rights and development should not be viewed or pursued as separate ends in themselves â€“ competing objectives for separate organisations or programmes â€“ but as mutually reinforcing. Both drive the same goal: the inclusive, equitable and qualitative development of human well-being. Further, to transform human rights into meaningful development catalysts one needs to be able to â€œexerciseâ€ the given rights â€“ which in turn calls for strengthening social capabilities and state capacities.   Originality/value Unlike some previous works, this paper does not prescribe a particular remedy. Rather, accepting the intangibility of human rights and the associated large degree of subjectivity, it provokes the reader to move beyond the strictures of conventional theories and frameworks. For example, the difference between â€œhavingâ€ and â€œexercisingâ€ a right â€“ a stark feature of actual practice has frequently been omitted from theoretical discussion. Likewise, the role of non-state actors, such as MNCs and TNCs, and the way in which their power can impede or support development goals and human rights is a relatively new point of discussion demanding further exploration.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-09-2017-0079?af=R","2018-11-30 10:37:06","35","Journal of Financial Crime"

It also seeks to understand the key factors that motivate employees to engage in fraudulent behaviours against their employers, and the consequences of these fraudulent behaviours on small businesses (SMEs) in Nigeria.   Design/methodology/approach The empirical study involves the use of quantitative research. Data were collected through structured questionnaires from 159 business owners, sales representatives, cashiers and suppliers. Frequency distribution, percentages, Pearson correlation and multiple regression analysis were used to analyse the collected data.   Findings The findings from this research show a significant relationship between personal and organisational factors and employee theft. Particularly, organisational factors made the strongest positive contribution to employee theft. The research also revealed that employee theft had significant effects on employers but less significance on employees. In addition, the research revealed that many businesses did not have preventive measures against employee theft in their firms. The findings of this study were compared with existing literature.   Originality/value This study shows the relationship between different factors that could cause an employee to engage in fraudulent behaviours, particularly in SMEs in Nigeria.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-03-2017-0025?af=R","2018-11-30 10:37:06","52","Journal of Financial Crime"
"13818","Judicial Corruption: the Case of Nigeria","Journal of Financial Crime, Volume 25, Issue 4, Page 926-939, October 2018. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose The purpose of this paper is to diagnostically explore the phenomenon of judicial corruption in Nigeria, its causative factors and generate strategies such as sonic therapeutic intervention, among others, that would facilitate an amelioration of the situation. The judiciary which is supposed to be last hope of justice for the Nigerian citizenry has been proven beyond reasonable doubt to have been infected with the virus of corruption, and therefore, an urgent call for action to rectify the situation is imperative.   Design/methodology/approach The study uses a qualitative approach rooted in case study tradition.   Findings The findings showed that power and testosterone, cheating proclivity, family pressure, qualitative passion and ignorance, low self-control, inordinate kleptocratic desire, unrestrained mind and sensory modalities, phenomenological mindset and identity crisis as endogenous contributive factors of judicial corruption in Nigeria.   Research limitations/implications The limitation of the study stemmed from the fact that inasmuch as a perception of corruption and corruption are cultural phenomena, the study results cannot be generalizable.   Practical implications The practical implication of the research is rooted in the fact that the Nigerian judiciary can gain from the study results and recommendation(s) if implemented without fear or favor for the overall renewal of the judiciary and the nation at large.   Social implications The study is geared toward ameliorating the Nigerian corrupt judiciary or repositioning the judiciary on its pivotal dignity, and hence, its social implication cannot be overemphasized inasmuch as a positive social change would prevail if the study results and recommendation(s) are aligned with and implemented.   Originality/value Inquiry on judicial corruption through the lens of qualitative research with Nigeria as a case study is highly understudied, and hence, this research fills the gap in the financial crime literature.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-02-2017-0011?af=R","2018-11-30 10:37:06","33","Journal of Financial Crime"

Design/methodology/approach The paper uses conceptual models obtained from enterprise theory and economics, as well as criminology, and makes use of case studies through the application of these models.   Findings The paper finds that when viewed from a financial perspective, there is no meaningful difference in distinguishing between the groups because many have undergone processes of convergence and transformation, such that they assume each otherâ€™s operational and motivational characteristics. However, the answer also depends on how precisely one defines each type of illicit group as well as the transitions they undergo.   Originality/value The value of this paper is that it applies two separate models on interactions between organised crime and terrorist organisations, the terrorâ€“crime continuum and interaction spectrum, to real life situations. After assessing their validity for more recent examples of such illicit groups, it then provides a balanced argument as to distinguishing between organised crime and terrorism. One limitation towards the paperâ€™s originality, however, is that it draws mainly from pre-existing literature.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-02-2017-0012?af=R","2018-11-30 10:37:06","27","Journal of Financial Crime"

                  <span>
                    <h3>Research Question</h3>
                    <p>In what proportion of intimate partner abuse cases (in which offenders have made some level of formal admission of wrongdoing) would victims, offenders or both be willing to attend a face-to-face restorative justice conference, at least in principle?</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Data</h3>
                    <p>The study included offenders, victims and dyads in 75 low-harm cases of intimate partner abuse (IPA), defined as punishable by 10 or fewer days of Cambridge Crime Harm Index value for the offence. Eligible cases were limited to couples involving a male offender who had admitted responsibility for the harm and a female victim, both age 18&nbsp;years or over, in cases finalised within 6&nbsp;months of the incident and with no new incidents since the presenting offence. Of the 75 eligible cases of IPA for which contact was attempted with 150 people, 54 people agreed to grant interviews: 34 victims (45% of those successfully contacted) and 20 offenders (49% of successful contacts) completed interviews, including 13 cases in which both offender and victim in the dyad gave interviews.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Method</h3>
                    <p>Structured phone interviews were conducted by police officers or staff within 10&nbsp;months of case reporting. The key feasibility measure was a statement that the interviewee would be &lsquo;likely&rsquo; to agree to participate in a face-to-face restorative justice conference (RJC) for crimes in an IPA relationship, based on a 5-point Likert scale.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Findings</h3>
                    <p>There were 14 (41%) victims and five (25%) offenders who indicated they would likely or definitely be willing to participate in a RJC if one were offered to them now. Seven of the 13 dyads matched on some degree of willingness to participate between both parties. Victims and offenders with some reason for ongoing contact with the other party tended to be more interested in RJCs than those who had severed contact. Victims reporting lower current levels of fear of the offender and who self-reported fewer prior offences were more willing to participate in RJCs. Cases in which victims indicated willingness had more often resulted in a caution than a charge.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>These findings demonstrated an appreciable level of interest in RJCs amongst victims and offenders in IPA cases with low harm. Based on the results of this study, a controlled trial could be considered offering this intervention to couples fitting the eligibility criteria of this study, with emphasis on couples found most likely to accept the offer.</p>

Consequently, a plethora of literature emerged, looking to better understand the nature of these actors. An aspect that has attracted substantial interest is the inter-relation between terrorism and organised crime (OC). This paper aims to answer the question as to whether, for the purpose of controlling and mitigating the threat they pose to society, there is meaning in differentiating between terrorist organisations (TOs) and organised crime groups (OCGs).   Design/methodology/approach The first section of the paper will provide an account of the various kinds of threats posed by OCGs and TOs. The subsequent section will question whether it is possible, in todayâ€™s globalised era, to distinguish between these two actors, while the last sections will ask if such a differentiation is desirable.   Findings OCGs and TOs display a clear divergence: the formerâ€™s motivation is financial while the latterâ€™s political. With the end of the Cold War, however, each type of organisation has been building up the capabilities of the other, helped by the force of global networks. As such, these two actors now exist within the same body â€“ a continuum â€“ that renders their separation difficult. As to the question of desirability, the separation of the two phenomena has often led to the adoption of highly disproportionate militarised and securitised measures, resulting in a dangerous blending of law enforcement and security service methodology.   Originality/value Many have argued for the separation of the â€œterroristâ€ from the â€œcriminalâ€, on the grounds that the former is particularly heinous and deserving of more severe measures. Others have studied the evolution of these two phenomena to understand whether the lines separating them have been blurring and the extent to which this affects law-enforcement. This paper goes beyond notions of feasibility and poses the following question: has the traditional separation of these phenomena led to a desirable regime?","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-02-2017-0015?af=R","2018-12-01 10:21:37","48","Journal of Financial Crime"
"13833","Terrorism Financing and Money Laundering: Two Sides of the Same Coin?","Journal of Financial Crime, Volume 25, Issue 4, Page 962-968, October 2018. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyse how terrorism financing can be assimilated with money launderning when the amounts ofmoney involved differ so markedly. Not only is the cost of financing terrorist attacks minimal compared to the huge sums often at stake in financial crimes, but also the psychological profile of terrorists, who are reclusive by nature, contrasts starkly with that of financial criminals, who are usually fully integrated members of society. When terrorism financing is equated with money laundering this represents a utilitarian approach in that it facilitates the creation of a security strategy and stifles criticism of criminogenic capitalismthat turns a blind eye to tax evasion.   Design/methodology/approach The analysis is conceptual, focussing on the assimilation of terrorism financing with money laundering. There is an interview with a French magistrate, specialized in the fight against corruption and white-collar crime, and data have been collected from international organizations and scholarly articles.   Findings The fight against money laundering and money dirtying has clearly sparked numerous controversies around evaluation, scope, criminal perpetrators and a lack of vital cooperation between administrative and judicial services.   Social implications This paper raises questions about the reasons behind the linking of money laundering and money dirtying by states and players in public international law and why the fight against money laundering is very much overshadowed by their focus on terrorist financing in dealing with the growing threat of Islamic State, otherwise known as ISIS or ISIL, in the Middle East and West Africa.   Originality/value The paper enables the reader to raise the question of similarities between the fight against money laundering and the fight against terrorism financing.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-03-2017-0021?af=R","2018-12-01 10:21:37","158","Journal of Financial Crime"
"13834","Be Like Water: Developing A Fluid Corruption Prevention Strategy","Journal of Financial Crime, Volume 25, Issue 4, Page 997-1023, October 2018. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose Based on the authorsâ€™ study, the purpose of this paper is to establish a foundation for assessing and deciding the most feasible corruption prevention activities with significant impact in reducing corruption in the Indonesian public sector. To accomplish this objective, this paper applies multiple theoretical perspectives simultaneously to better understand the behavioral aspects of corruption prevention strategy in Indonesia.   Design/methodology/approach This paper is part of the authorsâ€™ study to assess the corruption problem in the Indonesian public sector in the past decade primarily through examination of major corruption cases to highlight various behavioral issues that became the root causes of rampaging corruption in the country. This paper also discusses how such issues undermine the effectiveness of the existing corruption prevention strategy as well as how to properly address them.   Findings The authors establish that there are numerous overlooked behavioral issues that have rendered existing corruption prevention measures in the Indonesian public sector ineffective in hampering the regeneration of corruption. Gaining sufficient understanding on how public officialsâ€™ view on corruption is shaped by their culture and society is crucial in ascertaining what needs to be done to prevent corruption from reoccurring in the future. This study demonstrates that transformative learning needs to be systematically carried out to re-engineer organizational mindset to make it intolerant to corruption which includes unlearning the embedded knowledge of corruption. To support the execution of organizational unlearning discernment must be exercised to enable anti-corruption messages to be sent to the target groups. Nevertheless, due to various inherent behavioral issues within the Indonesian public institutions stimulating anti-corruption discernment is in itself a profound challenge. To promote anti-corruption discernment in the Indonesian public sector, this study proposes the Shame-oriented Anti-corruption Discernment Stimulation (SADS) which focuses on the â€œmanagement of shameâ€ in stimulating anti-corruption discernment within public institutions in Indonesia.   Research limitations/implications This study is self-funded and is relying primarily on documentary analysis in highlighting the behavioral issues that determine the success and failure of corruption prevention strategy in Indonesia. Future studies may benefit from interviews with experts in Indonesian culture as well as indigenous people who can offer a broader view on how self-conscious emotions such as shame and guilt are actually experienced in different regions in Indonesia.   Practical implications This paper contributes to the development of corruption prevention strategy by proposing a framework for systematically stimulating anti-corruption discernment within organizations that are part of collectivistic societies.   Originality/value This paper highlights the importance of behavior-oriented approaches in mitigating corruption in the Indonesian public sector.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-04-2017-0031?af=R","2018-12-01 10:21:37","34","Journal of Financial Crime"

In addition, recommendations are made that may help control this pervasive type of fraud.   Design/methodology/approach A range of different journal publications, information from government health institutions and law enforcement websites, healthcare fraud cases and healthcare laws are used as a basis to provide information about how fraudsters are committing healthcare fraud and how to prevent this fraud from occurring.   Findings Despite increased funding and prosecution efforts by the government, healthcare fraud continues to be a major threat to the US economy and public. While healthcare fraud will never be eradicated, specific efforts can be deployed to help rein in these complex fraud schemes.   Practical implications The paper provides a useful resource of information on healthcare fraud for healthcare providers, insurance companies, patients and the public that may help combat healthcare fraud and prevent financial losses.

"13837","The Case Studies of Fraud Prevention Mechanisms in the Malaysian Medium Enterprises","Journal of Financial Crime, Volume 25, Issue 4, Page 1024-1038, October 2018. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose The purpose of this paper is to identify the extent and type of fraud scheme, prevention mechanisms and challenges experienced by the Malaysian medium enterprises.   Design/methodology/approach The multiple case studies approach has been used in this study. The data were collected through interviews with the directors, owners, managers and supervisors of three medium-size enterprises.   Findings The findings suggest that the fraud cases experienced by the enterprises were related to broken trust and non-cash larceny. The implementation of fraud prevention mechanisms in the enterprises seem to be very limited because of resources and budget constraints.   Practical implications The findings of the study have an alarming implication for the owners and directors of the selected medium-size organizations. They seem to have shown proactivity and to have responded to fraud in their organizations by implementing fraud prevention mechanisms; however, not to the extent that large organizations have done. This fact may expose the companies to the risk of losing their competitiveness and the ability to survive in the marketplace.   Originality/value This paper contributes to the growing literature on the studies of fraud scheme and the fraud prevention mechanism in the medium-size enterprises, particularly in the context of developing country. Prior studies in these areas have predominantly been undertaken by large organizations of developed countries, which offer different environment, litigation and institutional setting thus limits the generalizability of fraud prevention mechanism to small- and medium-size businesses.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFC-05-2017-0034?af=R","2018-12-01 10:21:37","24","Journal of Financial Crime"

                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>Life-course persistent offenders experience earlier mortality compared to non-offenders (by about 7&nbsp;years) and adolescent-limited offenders (by about 8&nbsp;years). While life-course persistent offenders are not more likely to die early (&lt;&thinsp;40&nbsp;years) compared to other trajectory groups, they are more likely to experience premature mortality from late middle age into old age. Life-course persistent offenders are also more likely to experience unnatural deaths, with alcoholism confounding the relationship.</p>

                    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>That group differences in mortality risk did not emerge until age 55 (while offending is in decline) suggests that the relationship between offending and mortality is not direct and may be spurious. Knowledge about the relationship between criminal offending and mortality can be greatly improved by following participants into old age.</p>

                  <p>This study focusses on the role of trust in the illegal distribution of protected wildlife in China. This research attempts to contribute to the literature by disentangling the establishment of trust within the illegal wildlife trade based on ethnographic fieldwork between 2011 and 2016. Both traders and consumers are resorting to mechanisms of trust to foster exchange and to increase credibility of their agreements. This study discusses the existence of such mechanisms of trust within wildlife trafficking networks that are rather characteristic of illegal wildlife trade in China.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11417-018-9277-x","2018-12-03 08:30:19","43","Asian Journal of Criminology"

                  <span>
                    <h3>Objectives</h3>
                    <p>This paper reports a quasi-experimental evaluation of California&rsquo;s 1996 medical marijuana law (MML), known as Proposition 215, on statewide motor vehicle fatalities between 1996 and 2015.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>To infer the causal impact of California&rsquo;s MML enactment on statewide motor vehicle fatalities, we construct a synthetic control group for California (i.e., California had it NOT enacted MMLs) as a weighted sum of annual traffic fatality time series from a donor pool of untreated (no MML) states. The post-MML difference between California and its constructed counterfactual reflects the net effect of MMLs on statewide traffic fatalities. The synthetic control group design avoids the problematic homogeneity assumptions intrinsic to panel regression models, which have been employed in prominent studies of this topic.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>California&rsquo;s 1996 MML appears to have produced a large, sustained decrease in statewide motor vehicle fatalities amounting to an annual reduction between 588 and 900 vehicle fatalities. This finding is consistent across a wide range of model specifications and donor pool restrictions. In-sample placebo test results suggest that the estimated intervention effect is unlikely to be a spurious artifact and the &ldquo;leave-one-out&rdquo; sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the effect is not being driven by an individual or ensemble of influential donor pool states.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>Our focus on California as a case study limits our ability to generalize our estimate of the MML intervention on motor vehicle fatalities in California to other MML states; however, state-level MML interventions have major differences in their policy dimensions that seem unlikely to &ldquo;average out&rdquo; through aggregation.</p>

"13868","Revocation of Citizenship: How Punitive Theories and Restorative Justice Principles Apply to Acts of Disloyalty Toward the State","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>Several countries have recently amended or attempted to amend their laws to make it easier for the state to revoke citizenship. Such laws suggest that citizenship is tied to loyalty to the nation state, and can therefore be taken away if it is deemed to have been breached. This paper focuses on possible justifications for applying the punishment of citizenship revocation to acts that are &lsquo;contrary to the interests of the state&rsquo; or manifest &lsquo;disloyalty&rsquo; to the nation. The paper compares such acts with other criminal acts, and analyses them according to a conventional punitive model of criminal law that includes also a restorative justice perspective. The paper argues that revocation of citizenship as punishment for acts of disloyalty can be justified by several theories of punishment, such as retribution, deterrence, denunciation, rehabilitation, and prevention. When it comes to carrying out the revocation of citizenship, however, several problems may arise. As a possible solution, the paper suggests applying a restorative justice approach to minor or moderate acts of disloyalty.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10611-018-9803-x","2018-12-04 08:15:59","29","Crime, Law and Social Change"

"13875","Does Local Corruption Punish National Parties Votes?","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>Since 1978, an important process of decentralization in terms of regional competences has been taking place in Spain. In consequence, the behaviour of the regional and local administration has obtained an increasing relevant role. This process has a direct impact on the performance of politicians both at local and regional level, and on the results of elections. Recent data on elections show that national parties have lost the voting race at local elections. Moreover, at the same time as the economic boom in this country in the 2000s, there was also a boom in political corruption at the local level. Using a database that includes municipal data from 2004 to 2011 in Spain, this paper evaluates whether national parties lose votes at national elections due to the wrongdoing of their local candidates. Moreover, we focus on partisan effects, splitting the analysis according to the two main political parties in Spain. Our study resembles an experimental design, which yields two main conclusions. First, local corruption affects significantly the parties&rsquo; votes at national level, being the magnitude of the effect around one percentage point in absolute values. Second and interestingly, the sign of the results also depends on whether the corruption is on the right or the left wing.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10611-018-9806-7","2018-12-04 17:31:02","39","Crime, Law and Social Change"

                  <span>
                    <h3>Purpose</h3>
                    <p>Little is known about how ex-prisoners&rsquo; parole supervision experiences support or hinder the process of desistance. The aim of this article is to analyse the nature of parole supervision of Dutch (ex-)long-term prisoners in terms of official conditions, as well as the way in which parole officers (POs) and ex-prisoners navigate these conditions. The focus is particularly on the experienced supervision style and how this interacts with different dimensions of efforts at desistance.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>Twenty-three Dutch parolees were interviewed in depth at three waves starting in prison up to one year after their release from prison. A thematic analysis was undertaken to analyse the 69 interviews. In addition, the parole files of these ex-prisoners were examined containing information about conditions, violations and sanctions.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>Parole files revealed the practice of highly engaged parole officers, who worked with parolees to strengthen factors known to foster desistance and tried to accommodate the difficulties of navigating &lsquo;life outside&rsquo; after a relatively long prison sentence. However, the interviews showed that most parolees found their parole experience predominantly surveillance-oriented and not very helpful for desistance. Parole was experienced as most beneficial when parole officers were viewed as social workers or mentors and used their discretionary power to adjust conditions creating &lsquo;space&rsquo; for trial-and-error.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>This longitudinal study suggests that a policy culture and discourse of risk management do not necessarily preclude desistance support in parole supervision in the Netherlands, due to discretionary power of parole officers.</p>

"13880","Calibrating Student Perceptions of Punishment: A Specific Test of General Deterrence","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>General deterrence theory assumes objective risks of punishment and citizens&rsquo; perceptions of punishment risks are closely calibrated. Yet little empirical attention has been devoted to testing this assumption. Of the few studies that exist, most have tested the calibration with county-level indicators of objective punishment risk. This strategy has been criticized for being too far removed from the individual citizen: why should we expect citizens to know the punishment risks in such a large geographic unit? We estimated the calibration between objective punishment levels and individuals&rsquo; perceptions of those punishment levels by analyzing data drawn from a large sample of students (<em>n</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;11,085) from 44 schools in Ohio. Multi-level models found the calibration between objective punishment and students&rsquo; perceptions is weak and not statistically significant. More than half of our calibration estimates were in the wrong direction (i.e., they were negative) and results from interaction tests did not indicate that the calibration is any stronger among those with the highest levels of self-reported offending. We discuss the implications of these findings for policies rooted in general deterrence theory.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12103-018-9466-2","2018-12-05 07:30:46","44","American Journal of Criminal Justice"

Design/methodology/approach Operation Galley, a randomized control field trial, rank ordered and matched 120 hotels on size, star rating, location and estimated degree of suspicious behaviour. Hotels were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: Operation Galley hotels who received a procedurally just letter, followed by a personal visit with detectives; the letter-only hotels who received the procedurally just letter; and the business as usual hotels.   Findings Using repeated measures ANOVA and general linear models, results of the 12-month trial indicate that the Operation Galley condition led to an increase in police engagement with hoteliers, increasing the recognition, reporting and police enforcement of drug offenders.   Practical implications The Operation Galley trial demonstrates that the ILP approach helped foster positive engagement between hoteliers and detectives. The approach cultivated hoteliers as crime control partners and thereby increased the flow of human source intelligence, helping police to better target and respond to drug dealing problems in hotel rooms.   Originality/value Results of the Operation Galley trial demonstrate that hoteliers can be leveraged as crime control partners, providing important human source intelligence about drug dealing and facilitating the capacity of police to better respond to drug problems in hotels.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-08-2018-0126?af=R","2018-12-05 08:33:34","105","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

                  <p>Corruption and clientelism in the government, security and judicial institutions of developing and war-torn countries seriously affects the poor and hinders state effectiveness to deliver services, the rule of law and security. This article provides an overview of systemic corruption, patronage and nepotism; petty bribery (administrative corruption); and state capture. This is followed by an analysis of international anti-corruption strategies as a response to curb these mentioned drivers of corruption. Subsequently, comparative methods are prescribed to compare corruption in various countries. Initially, cases of strong political will to fulfil anti-corruption reform in Hong Kong and Singapore are covered. These are compared with several cases of narco-states infiltrated from powerful drug cartels perverting the judiciary, the rule of law and security are presented to identify the main challenges of namely state capture and systemic corruption. Public administration reform, civil service reform and meritocracy and pay reform are addressed as further strategies to curb corruption. The final part provides a roadmap of anti-corruption strategy based on the main causes and practices of corruption, and reform efforts to mitigate them, as identified in the paper. This is based on four areas: raising awareness; prevention; prosecution and sanctions; and detection. The purpose of such an approach is to provide solutions based on the main forms of corruption and clientelism, as analysed in the paper.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10611-018-9807-6","2018-12-05 09:31:18","49","Crime, Law and Social Change"

                    <p>A random sample of 100 recorded stop-and-search encounters was selected from all 601 encounters recorded by Greater Manchester Police between 1st January and 31st August 2017, with an average duration of 12&nbsp;minutes of combined video and audio with transcripts.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>These records were coded entirely by the first author for the four main dimensions of procedural justice and details about the actors/participants involved. The dimensions were combined into an overall index score of procedural justice for each encounter.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Findings</h3>
                    <p>Most stop-and-searches were characterised by a strong element of police allowing citizens to express voice, followed by police demonstrating respect and offering explanation. The lowest scores were given to &ldquo;conveying trustworthy motives&rdquo;. A standardised metric of each element into a measure of 0&ndash;100 coded mean scores for participation/voice&thinsp;=&thinsp;94, explanation/neutrality&thinsp;=&thinsp;65, respect&thinsp;=&thinsp;71 and trustworthy motives&thinsp;=&thinsp;47. In this latter category, not one officer linked the purpose of the stop and search to the wider organisational purpose of protecting society and helping to keep people safe.</p>

                  <span>
                    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>This evidence suggests the potential value of an ongoing tracking measure for police legitimacy which could be used as a supervisory and human development tool for operational officers, comparing individuals, units, areas and trends over time in objectively coded features of police behaviour towards citizens.</p>

                  <p>The MPOWER programme is a resource oriented intervention to support children and young people (CYP) affected by domestic violence and abuse. It draws on principles from feminist informed systemic family practice and creative therapies. The intervention was delivered in 4 European countries (Greece, Italy, Spain and England), reaching 58 CYP. This paper reports on young participants&rsquo; wellbeing outcomes and perceptions of the intervention. Participants completed the Children&rsquo;s Outcome Rating Scale, and the Children&rsquo;s Group Session Rating Scale (Duncan et al. <em>Journal of Brief Therapy, 3,</em> 3&ndash;12, <span>2003</span>). A descriptive analysis of this data suggests improvement in subjective wellbeing as CYP moved through this programme. Qualitative interviews were also conducted with 21 CYP, exploring their experience of the group intervention and of its impact. These interviews were analysed thematically (Braun and Clark <em>Qualitative Research in Psychology</em>, <em>3</em>(2), 77&ndash;101, <span>2006</span>). Three themes are discussed: These were &ldquo;Working Together: Building Trust and Sharing Common Experiences&rdquo;; &ldquo;Disclosures, creativity and working with emotions&rdquo;; and &ldquo;Roots and Branches: Working with relationships&rdquo;.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-0025-x","2018-12-06 00:17:32","49","Journal of Family Violence"

"13889","Exited Prostitution Survivor Policy Platform","<p>Survivors of prostitution propose a policy reform platform including three main pillars of priority: criminal justice reforms, fair employment, and standards of care. The sexual exploitation of prostituted individuals has lasting effects which can carry over into many aspects of life. In order to remedy these effects and give survivors the opportunity to live a full and free life, we must use a survivor-centered approach to each of these pillars to create change. First, reform is necessary in the criminal justice system to recognize survivors as victims of crime and not perpetrators, while holding those who exploited them fully responsible. Second, reform is necessary to assist survivors in finding fair employment by offering vocational training, financial counseling, and educational scholarships, as well as offering employment opportunities that utilize survivors&rsquo; vast array of skills and interests. Finally, standards of care for survivors exiting prostitution should focus on supporting survivors in our journeys and support short- and long-term resources that empower us. These systemic changes are necessary to recognize survivors as the valuable human beings we are and to support survivors in fulfilling our vast potential.</p>","https://digitalcommons.uri.edu/dignity/vol3/iss3/10","2018-12-07 04:32:42","29","Dignity: A Journal on Sexual Exploitation and Violence"

"13891","Higher Education For Police Professionals. the Dutch Case","<span><div>Abstract</div>In the Netherlands, already for some 20 years, a discourse on the relevance and nature of higher education for police professionals can be traced. To explain this discourse, the article consists of a reconstruction of the trajectory of change and an assessment of the current situation. Furthermore, a future perspective is included, which largely runs parallel with other forms of higher education for professions in the public sector. Key concepts, for instance, are the &lsquo;reflective practitioner&rsquo; and the &lsquo;hybrid professional&rsquo;. Also, a case is presented on the education of reflective practices, which exemplifies a didactics of teaching and learning in police practice. More than ever a close cooperation between police practice and police education is needed, as well as a clear focus on how &lsquo;learning by doing&rsquo; relates to the need of a solid knowledge base. Together, teachers and practitioners may challenge the student to develop a personal judgment on the connection between theories (concepts, words) and practice (experience, works).</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay089/5232557?rss=1","2018-12-07 07:48:33","71","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"
"13892","The Duration of Criminal Careers: How Many Offenders Do Not Desist Up to Age 61?","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Purpose</h3>
                    <p>The main aim of this article is to investigate the duration of criminal careers, to assess how many offenders desist from offending (i.e., terminate offending) up to age 61.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>The Cambridge Study in Delinquent Development is a prospective longitudinal survey of 411 London males originally studied at age 8 in 1961. Their criminal records have been searched repeatedly up to age 61, and their self-reported offending was measured up to age 48, when 93% of males were interviewed.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>Forty-four percent of males were convicted, and many criminal careers were very long; 26% of convicted males had a duration of 20&nbsp;years or more. The probability of being reconvicted was substantial even after a gap of 10 (20%) or 15&nbsp;years (19%) after the previous conviction, but it was only 8% after a 30-year gap and only 6% after a 40-year gap. Offenders who had been conviction-free for 30 or more years since their last conviction had a similar self-reported offending score to non-offenders at age 48.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>It seems likely that those offenders (49%) who had been conviction-free for 30 or more years had truly desisted. In contrast, those offenders who were conviction-free for less than 10&nbsp;years (22%) probably had not desisted up to age 61. Desistance is more uncertain for the remainder of the offenders.</p>

"13894","Sub-Regional â€˜other-Accentâ€™ Effects on Lay Listenersâ€™ Speaker Identification Abilities: A Voice Line-Up Study With Speakers and Listeners From the North East of England","<p>Previous studies have shown that listeners perform worse in speaker identification experiments when they are unfamiliar with the accents of the speakers. Such effects have been documented for listeners hearing unfamiliar foreign languages (language familiarity effect) and unfamiliar regional accents ('other-accent' effect). The present study investigates the 'other-accent' effect at a sub-regional level. Listeners from three different localities (Newcastle, Sunderland and Middlesbrough) within the same greater dialectal region (the North East of England) participated in one of three target-present voice line-ups using samples spoken by speakers from one of the three localities. Listeners who heard a voice line-up in their own local accent (ingroup listeners) missed the target speaker's voice significantly less often than listeners who heard a voice line-up comprised of speakers of one of the other two local accents (out-group listeners). The proportions of correct hits and false alarms were approximately similar across in-group and out-group listeners.</p> <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> <o:OfficeDocumentSettings> <o:AllowPNG />

"13895","Discourse Processes and Topic Management in False Confession Contamination By Police Investigators","<div>This article advances an analysis of discourse processes which produce confession contamination by two police investigators in an interrogation which resulted in a voluntary false confession. Specifically, I identify and exemplify processes which I call &lsquo;clueing&rsquo;, &lsquo;stacking&rsquo;, &lsquo;marking&rsquo; and &lsquo;telling&rsquo;, which are recruited to both covertly and overtly disclose inside crime knowledge to an innocent suspect who is being questioned about such knowledge but is, of course, unable to supply it.</div>","https://journals.equinoxpub.com/index.php/IJSLL/article/view/34951","2018-12-07 11:17:51","30","International Journal of Speech Language and the Law"
"13896","Individual Patterns of Disfluency Across Speaking Styles: A Forensic Phonetic Investigation of Standard Southern British English","<p>Features of speech related to fluency such as filled and silent pauses, sound prolongations, repetitions and self-interruptions exhibit considerable variation among speakers, yet the speaker-specificity of such features has received little attention inforensic phonetic research. The present study investigates the extent to which individual differences in disfluency behaviour are preserved across different speaking styles, a key concern for forensic speaker comparison cases. Disfluency phenomena in the speech of 20 male speakers of Standard Southern British English undertaking a simulated police interview task are compared with the occurrence of the same set of phenomena in the speech of the same speakers participating in a telephone conversation with an 'accomplice'. The speakers' disfluency features are analysed using TOFFA 'Taxonomy of Fluency Features for Forensic Analysis' (McDougall and Duckworth 2017). Individuals exhibit a wide range of variation in their overall rate of production of disfluency features, and these rates are relatively consistent within-speaker across interview and telephone styles. The results for each specific disfluency feature type also show patterns of relatively consistent behaviour within-speaker across-style for most features. For both interview and telephone styles, discriminant analyses based on speaker profiles of disfluency features demonstrate that disfluency features carry speaker-specific information which could be considered alongside other analyses in forensic speaker comparison cases.</p>","https://journals.equinoxpub.com/index.php/IJSLL/article/view/37241","2018-12-07 11:17:51","31","International Journal of Speech Language and the Law"
"13897","Between-Speaker Rhythmic Variability Is Not Dependent on Language Rhythm, As Evidence From Persian Reveals","<p>Acoustic measures of speech rhythm based on the durational characteristics of consonantal and vocalic intervals (henceforth C- or V-intervals) as well as syllabic intensity reveal between-speaker variability. The evidence obtained so far is based on speakers of stressed-timed languages, which are assumed to have complex consonant clusters and a higher degree of vowel reduction. Speakers of stressed-timed languages might operate their articulatory organs in different ways due to the syllable complexity and vowel reduction. Complex consonant clusters are released differently, and vowel reduction tends to be produced more or less strongly depending on speakers. When a language lacks such features, it is possible that rhythmic variation between its speakers decreases. In the present study, we aimed at exploring between- and within-speaker rhythmic variability in Persian, an Indo-European language categorised as syllable-timed. Acoustic correlates of speech rhythm (%V, &Delta;V[ln], &Delta;C[ln], n-PVI-V) and articulation rate were obtained from two Persian corpora with different sources of within-speaker variability. In the first corpus, the source of within-speaker variability mainly comes from non-contemporaneous recording sessions, and in the second corpus, from different speech rates. Results revealed that there were significant differences between speakers in all investigated speech rhythm measures in Persian and %V best discriminated between speakers. This reveals that the lack of typical stress-time features does not affect between-speaker variability in speech rhythm.</p>","https://journals.equinoxpub.com/index.php/IJSLL/article/view/37110","2018-12-07 11:17:51","21","International Journal of Speech Language and the Law"

The defence attorney integrates speech, gestures and exhibits to shape motion events and spatial images into relevant objects of evidentiary knowledge, creating inconsistencies in the witness&rsquo;s account under the auspices of merely showing the jury locations and movements in the defendant&rsquo;s home. We demonstrate how the encoding of motion events percolates in and through a polyrhythmic and multidimensional poetic format to naturalise gender ideologies &ndash; cultural expectations governing victim identity &ndash; in the social construction of rape&rsquo;s legal facticity.</p><p><a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/h48dvk62we9o1j0/35619-108856-1-SP.mpg?dl=0"" target=""_blank"">Click here for example 1 video</a></p><p><a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/i6686690lmdg9b4/35619-108857-1-SP.mpg?dl=0"" target=""_blank"">Click here for example 2 video</a></p>","https://journals.equinoxpub.com/index.php/IJSLL/article/view/35619","2018-12-07 11:17:51","22","International Journal of Speech Language and the Law"

                  <span>
                    <h3>Research Question</h3>
                    <p>To what extent does citizen-reported crime in 500-meter square areas in Denmark, and arrests of individuals legally excluded from those areas for intimidating behavior, decline in the 3-month time periods in which their Exclusion Zone Orders (EZOs) are in effect, compared to the most recent 3-month period prior to the EZO?</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Data</h3>
                    <p>Individual-level data on 2441 arrests of the 161 offenders who were the subject of all 218 EZOs granted in Denmark from 2009 through 2016 were collected from the Danish National Police Database, as well as place-based reported crime data for the location of each of the busiest 7 (out of 41) of the Exclusion Zones (EZs) and matched control areas.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>The two units of analysis are individuals targeted by the EZOs and location of the EZs. A descriptive time-series analysis compared offending before and individuals received EZOs. Standardized mean differences were calculated between seven locations which received a high rate of EZOs and their matched control sites, all distinguishing police-reported crimes from those reported by victims or witnesses.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Findings</h3>
                    <p>A moderate decrease in the number of citizen-reported offenses was observed in six out of seven targeted zones when the EZOs were in effect. There was no indication of a displacement effect to offenses outside the EZ.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>The positive results of this tracking study suggest that more rigorous testing the use of EZOs across Denmark could demonstrate that EZOs can cause reductions in crime and harm.</p>

"13906","A Qualitative Exploration of Police Officersâ€™ Experiences, Challenges, and Perceptions of Cybercrime","<span><div>Abstract</div>Victimization from cybercrime has increased exponentially over the past decade. Frontline police officers are dealing with a variety of crimes different than those existing in an era before the advent of digital technology. Frontline officers are expected to encourage members of the public to report such crimes, to investigate them, as well as keeping up-to-date with the latest developments in this ever-changing landscape. This study explored the issues that frontline officers are dealing with on a daily basis when it comes to cybercrime. Sixteen frontline police officers took part in focus groups exploring key questions around aspects of cybercrime. The key themes discussed in this article include the difficulty of defining what is cybercrime, the contrast between the speed of developments in cybercrime and the speed of investigation, and the ineffectiveness of current training. The results are discussed in the context of a need for clearer training information to be delivered to all officers and staff who come into contact with aspects of cybercrime.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay090/5233865?rss=1","2018-12-07 15:48:41","78","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"

                    <h3>Objectives</h3>
                    <p>Our study questions the common assumption of random DK responses in criminology survey data and emphasizes the importance of understanding and handling DK for gaining substantive criminological knowledge. It examines the individual-level and neighborhood-level correlates of the propensity to give the DK response to questions on individual perception of neighborhood crime in Chongqing, China.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>We designed and conducted an original survey of 4839 residents from 100 urban neighborhoods in Chongqing, China in 2016. Random intercept hierarchical linear models were used to examine the effects of individual-level variables on uncertainty towards neighborhood crime and the effects of neighborhood social process variables, controlling for neighborhood composition.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>At least in some instances, DK appears to be the most valid response, reflecting actual uncertainty and lack of knowledge about neighborhood crime. DK responses have substantive correlates at both the individual and neighborhood level. Of particular interest, neighborhood social cohesion is negatively associated with individual uncertainty about neighborhood crime, controlling for neighborhood composition. There is a significant interaction between neighborhood semi-public social control and neighborhood poverty in predicting DK.</p>

                    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>Understanding the meanings behind DK has important implications for whether to include the DK option in survey designs and how to handle DK responses in data analysis when they occur. When DK is a valid answer for many respondents, not including the DK option in the survey instrument forces respondents to choose a nonexistent answer, which can result in misleading interpretations.</p>

                  <p>We examined whether eyewitness confidence, familiarity with the defendant (defined as number of prior exposures), and eyewitness age (Study 1 only) influenced mock jurors in a murder trial. Participants read a criminal mock trial transcript where the eyewitness reported seeing the defendant once or many times (vs. none) and answered questions relating to the defendant&rsquo;s guilt, culpability, and the accuracy of the eyewitness&rsquo; identification. In Studies 1 and 2 (<em>N</em>&nbsp;=&thinsp;542 and <em>N</em>&nbsp;=&thinsp;169, respectively) only confidence influenced jurors&rsquo; judgments with more guilt judgments and higher likelihood of identification accuracy when the witness espoused high (vs. low) confidence. Study 3 (<em>N</em>&nbsp;=&thinsp;179) utilized a stronger operationalization of familiarity by explicitly stating the number of times the eyewitness had seen the defendant prior to the crime (e.g., 0, 10, or 20 times). Mock jurors were more likely to believe that the defendant was guilty when the eyewitness had seen him 10 times prior to the crime compared to zero times. Additionally, there was a trend for more favorable perceptions of the eyewitness as familiarity with the defendant increased. These results suggest that in some cases, familiarity between an eyewitness and defendant can impact mock juror decision-making.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9306-9","2018-12-12 05:18:55","33","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"

Variations included: &ldquo;silhouette and question mark box&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;silhouette box&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;question mark box&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;not here box&rdquo; vs. no box (i.e., control). Lineup instructions for each option included a statement that the perpetrator may or may not be present. Participants were more likely to make an accurate identification when presented with a target-present lineup compared to a target-absent lineup. Including some form of graphical representation of &ldquo;not here&rdquo; did not increase the correct identification or correct rejection rates compared to when no representation was presented with the lineup. Adolescents and adults provided a comparable number of perpetrator descriptors; however, overall, adolescents produced a higher proportion of accurate responses. Participants who reported more perpetrator descriptors also were more likely to make a correct identification or correct rejection in the subsequent identification task.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9307-8","2018-12-12 05:18:55","34","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"

"13959","Interoperability","<p>Today, uncertainty is what is more certain in our daily living. In the domain of security and protection, uncertainty becomes a critical condition for the decision-making process. Crowd&rsquo;s protection is a complex and arduous problem in what concerns to guaranty security and safety during mass gatherings. In Europe, after several terrorist attacks targeting crowded places, the first responders had to cooperate to mitigate the terrible effects of a terrorist attack, violence or an accident. The promotion of a better cooperation amongst first responders should be based on a multilevel interoperability model to solve potential and real coordination problems during rescue operations. It is clear that an interoperable system will respond in a better and integrated way to save lives. Preparedness is the key element. We all know that there are some traditional barriers for the interoperability implementation, such as technological, cultural, organisational and individual. The presentation of a general reflexion about the critical aspects of interoperability governance (plan, decision-making and training) tackles key issues such as innovation, harmonisation of safety and security culture, articulation of top-down and bottom-up approaches, operational procedures, technological support and general training. The discussion of a diagnosis model to assess the European interoperability continuum will give some food for thoughts to draft a roadmap to enhance the potential of each organisation and the overall interoperability system</p>","https://bulletin.cepol.europa.eu/index.php/bulletin/article/view/339","2018-12-12 10:19:51","41","European Law Enforcement Research Bulletin"

"13980","Risk Factors For Occupational Stress Among Greek Police Officers","Policing: An International Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose In view of the absence of police stress research in Greece, the purpose of this paper is to measure occupational stress among police officers and to investigate occupational stress risk factors.   Design/methodology/approach A cross-sectional study with a convenience sample was conducted among 336 police officers in Athens, Greece. Data collection was performed during January to March 2018 and the response rate was 77.8 percent. Demographic characteristics, job characteristics, lifestyle factors and coping strategies were considered possible risk factors. The â€œOperational Police Stress Questionnaireâ€ and the â€œOrganizational Police Stress Questionnaireâ€ were used to measure occupational stress, while the â€œBrief Copeâ€ questionnaire was used to measure coping strategies.   Findings Regarding service operation, the most stressor events were personal relationships outside work, tiredness, bureaucracy, injury risk and lack of leisure for family and friends. Regarding service organization, the most stressor events were lack of personnel, inappropriate equipment, lack of meritocracy, lack of sources and inappropriate distribution of responsibilities in work. According to multivariate analysis, increased use of avoidance-focused coping strategy, and decreased sleeping, physical exercise and family/friends support were associated with increased occupational stress. Moreover, police officers who work out of office experienced more occupational stress than police officers who work in office.   Originality/value To the best of the authorsâ€™ knowledge, this is the first study in Greece addressing the risk factors for occupational stress among police officers. Modifiable occupational stress risk factors among police officers were found and should be carefully managed to decrease stress and improve mental health.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-09-2018-0131?af=R","2018-12-13 16:20:21","37","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"
"13981","Offender Interviews: Implications For Intelligence-Led Policing","Policing: An International Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose Intelligence-led policing (ILP) involves the analysis of data to inform the development and implementation of strategic actions aimed at more efficiently reducing crime. The purpose of this paper is to examine how chronic acquisitive offenders â€“ a focus of ILP â€“ respond to police patrol, and how this knowledge can be turned into actionable strategies to reduce crime.   Design/methodology/approach Interviews were conducted with 137 chronic offenders who had multiple convictions for burglary, robbery and/or vehicle crime. The interviews involved the collection of both qualitative and quantitative data, including responses to situational crime vignettes.   Findings When encountering police patrols, criminals were initially more likely to displace (e.g. committing crime elsewhere and/or later in the day) than to desist from offending. Some of the conditions under which police patrol was most effective were identified, including offendersâ€™ fear of being recognized by officers. Repeated thwarted crime attempts appeared to be most impactful, with even the most chronic offenders becoming â€œworn down.â€   Practical implications The profiles of top offenders should be systematically disseminated to front line officers to augment the effectiveness of police patrol and minimize the possibility of crime displacement.   Originality/value Offender interviews are a valuable source of information but they have been underutilized within an ILP framework. This research illustrates how offender interview research can inform and support the role of police in preventing crime.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-07-2018-0096?af=R","2018-12-13 16:20:21","104","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"
"13982","Community Policing and Intelligence-Led Policing","Policing: An International Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;  Purpose Despite increased scholarly inquiry regarding intelligence-led policing (ILP) and popularity among law enforcement agencies around the globe, ambiguity remains regarding the conceptual foundation and appropriate measurement of ILP. Although most scholars agree that ILP is indeed a unique policing philosophy, there is less consensus regarding the relationship between ILP and the ever-present model of community-oriented policing (COP). Consequently, there is a clear need to study the empirical distinctions and overlaps in these policing philosophies as implemented by US law enforcement agencies. The paper aims to discuss these issues.   Design/methodology/approach Data were gleaned from the 2007 LEMAS and 2009 NIJ Intelligence surveys. A total of 227 unique police agencies in the USA are included. A series of bivariate, exploratory factor analyses and structural models are used to determine discriminatory or convergent validity across COP and ILP constructs.   Findings The goal was to answer the question: are these two policing philosophies are being implemented as separate and distinct strategies? Results of our exploratory and structural models indicate that COP and ILP loaded on unique latent constructs. This affirms the results of the bivariate correlations, and indicates that COP and ILP have discriminant measurement validity. In other words, COP and ILP are conceptually distinct, even when implemented in police departments across the USA. Implications of these findings and suggestions for future research are discussed.   Originality/value This is the first study to empirically test the discriminant or convergent validity of COP and ILP.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PIJPSM-07-2018-0105?af=R","2018-12-13 16:20:21","120","Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management"

                  <span>
                    <h3>Objectives</h3>
                    <p>This randomised controlled trial tested the effect of immediate versus delayed, as well as repeated, questioning on memory retrieval regarding details of officer-involved shootings.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>A sample of 87 police officers experienced &ldquo;active armed offender&rdquo; training scenarios followed by a memory questionnaire testing their recall and recognition of details of the scenario. Officers were randomly assigned to one of two experimental groups. Group 1 completed the questionnaire immediately after the training scenario and again 2&nbsp;days later, while group 2 completed the survey 2&nbsp;days later only.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>Linear mixed models showed that delayed questioning negatively impacted officers&rsquo; recognition of correct details of the incident, but only for details not directly associated with threat stimuli. This pattern was supported by the free recall data. Further, officers who were questioned immediately did not experience the same memory decay over time, showing that early questioning can aid memory retention. Officers were also better at recognising correct threat-relevant details (compared to non-threat relevant) that were visual, but the reverse was true for auditory details.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>We found no support for the position that delay improves officers&rsquo; memory. However, rather than finding universal memory decay over time, the interaction between timing and type of details being recalled revealed a more nuanced picture. This knowledge assists understanding of the limitations of information provided by officers under different interviewing conditions.</p>

                  <span>
                    <h3>Objectives</h3>
                    <p>Explore the typical &ldquo;packages&rdquo; of probation conditions and assess general and interactive racial and ethnic disparities in assignment to these &ldquo;packages&rdquo;.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>Latent class analysis (LCA) is applied as an exploratory modeling technique to uncover the nature of heterogeneity in probation conditions using novel and detailed data for over 2100 adults convicted of a felony in two urban counties. Class enumeration procedures use the Bayesian Information Criterion and correct for potential violations of conditional independence assumption. Model verification is assessed using mean posterior probabilities, confidence intervals for class differentiability, split sample checks and multiple iterations with random starting points. The influence of race and ethnicity, along with other legal and extralegal factors on assignment of probation condition &ldquo;packages&rdquo; identified is estimated using multinomial regression.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>Meaningful and discrete classes that ranged in their likely combinations, type, and number of conditions are identified by LCA with high assignment accuracy. Results from regression models suggest race and ethnicity play a role in assignment of probation conditions. Young black offenders and black drug offenders are particularly more likely to receive a wider range of and more restrictive&nbsp;conditions.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>LCA has the potential of classifying the multiple components of probation sentences without masking the heterogeneous nature of the conditions and imposing classification systems. Heterogeneity in the assignment of probation conditions represents a source of racial and ethnic sentencing disparities.</p>

                  <p>Despite empirical evidence that personnel selection assessments may be more effective when they incorporate actuarial (standardized, evidence-based interpretation guidelines) and contextualized (job-specific item language) components, relevant research specific to law enforcement settings is extremely limited. The Matrix-Predictive Uniform Law Enforcement Selection Evaluation (M-PULSE) Inventory, an example of such an assessment, has experienced increased popularity as a valuable pre- and post-conditional law enforcement screener. Yet, relatively little is known about its psychometric properties beyond the normative sample. In the first peer-reviewed study to focus on the M-PULSE, we examined the instrument in a large (<em>N</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;1202) sample of officer candidates in the Western USA. Results supported the reliability, factor structure, and lack of gender or ethnic bias of the M-PULSE, and scores were generally uncorrelated with age and educational background. These results empirically support the M-PULSE as a psychometrically sound instrument for law enforcement selection, and more broadly, may espouse actuarial, contextualized assessment methods.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9290-0","2018-12-14 15:20:40","26","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"

                  <p>Over the past 5&ndash;7&nbsp;years, there has been growing interest by criminal justice scholars in the area of positive criminology and in the development of gender-responsive treatment programs. A necessary condition for advances in these endeavors is explicating relevant psychological constructs and relying on reliable and valid measures. In this investigation, we explore the psychometric properties of the Self-Compassion Survey (SCS) in a sample of 117 incarcerated women. Participants at a maximum-security state women&rsquo;s prison completed this cross-sectional, self-report study by filling out the SCS as well as measures of resilience and mindfulness. Results revealed that subscale and total SCS scores had good internal consistency and positively correlated with the other assessed constructs, as expected. Moreover, subscale means in this sample were similar to other samples of women previously reported in the literature. Taken together, our findings suggest that the SCS is a reliable and valid measure in this population and therefore is an appropriate tool to use in exploring the role of self-compassion in the lives of incarcerated women.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11896-018-9304-y","2018-12-14 15:20:40","38","Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology"

                    <p>Using DMAP data, we show that there are multiple approaches that can be used in analyzing block randomized designs, and that those approaches will yield differing estimates of statistical significance. We develop outcomes using both models with and without interaction, and utilizing both Type I and Type III sums-of-squares approaches. We also examine the impacts of using randomization inference, an approach for estimating <em>p</em> values not based on approximations using normal distribution theory, to adjust for possible small <em>N</em> biases in estimating standard errors.</p>

                  <span>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>The assumptions used for identifying the analytic approach produce a comparatively wide range of <em>p</em> values for the main DMAP program impacts on hot spots. Nonetheless, the overall conclusions drawn from our re-analysis remain consistent with the original analyses, albeit with more caution. Results were similar to the original analyses under different specifications supporting the identification of diffusion of benefits effects to nearby areas.</p>

                    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>The major contribution of our article is to clarify statistical modeling in unbalanced block randomized studies. The introduction of blocking adds complexity to the models that are estimated, and care must be taken when including interaction effects in models, whether they are ANOVA models or regression models. Researchers need to recognize this complexity and provide transparent and alternative estimates of study outcomes.</p>

Analysis included capturing frequencies, correlations, ANOVAs, structural equation modelling (SEM) for quantitative data, and thematic analysis of the qualitative data. The findings show that 5% of police officer in the USA sample and 12% of police officer in Australian sample had no support for problem-solving; police officers in the USA had bigger social networks; the reasons given for not identifying their line manager as part of their social support included &lsquo;the unapproachability of managers&rsquo; and &lsquo;poor managers/bullying&rsquo; and SEM showed a significant relationship between perceived organizational support (from management), social networks, and employee engagement.

                  <p>Women in South Africa have high rates of depression and intimate partner violence&nbsp;(IPV), and they often co-occur. Women living with HIV who experience IPV are particularly likely to experience elevated levels of depressive symptoms and are more likely to persist. Although the association between IPV and depression has been examined extensively, the role of depression on IPV has not. Therefore, this study examined the bidirectional association between IPV and depressive symptoms in South Africa (SA). Participants were <em>N&thinsp;=</em>&nbsp;699 pregnant women with HIV in rural SA who completed measures of depressive symptoms and IPV at baseline (<em>M&thinsp;=</em>&nbsp;17.52&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;5.77&nbsp;weeks of pregnancy), 32&nbsp;weeks antenatally, and 6- and 12-months postnatally. Depressive symptoms were linked to increased psychological IPV from baseline to 32-weeks, and from 32-weeks to 6-months. However, from 6-months to 12-months, depressive symptoms were associated with decreased psychological IPV. Psychological IPV was linked to depressive symptoms from baseline to 32-weeks. Depressive symptoms were associated with physical IPV from 32-weeks to 6-months, and 6-months to 12-months. Physical IPV was associated with increased depressive symptoms from baseline to 32-weeks, and from 32-weeks to 6-months. Findings merit replication, as there may be measurement differences of psychological IPV in SA. However, targeting depressive symptoms and IPV concurrently in prevention and intervention programs may help optimize maternal and outcomes in the context of prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-0027-8","2018-12-17 08:20:07","23","Journal of Family Violence"

"14088","Understanding the Role of Parenting in Developing Radical Beliefs: Lessons Learned From Indonesia","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>Prior research suggests that family-related factors may be associated with a predisposition towards radicalism. This qualitative study aims to investigate if parents who are former members of an extremist organisation and parents from typical Islamic communities in Indonesia differ in their perceptions about the role of parenting in contributing to preventing their families from radicalisation. Using focus group methodology, the current study (<em>N</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;27) compared two groups (Group 1 consisted 7 former extremists and Group 2 consisted of 20 parents from moderate Islamic communities in Indonesia) to assess their beliefs about the role of parenting in the development of radical ideology. Three aspects were investigated: (a) Perceptions about parenting, parenting values and beliefs, (b) Perceptions of radicalisation, including associated factors to radicalisation and extremism, and (c) Parenting roles to develop or prevent children from radicalisation. Implications of the key findings for the prevention of radicalism are discussed in this study.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1057/s41284-018-00162-6","2018-12-18 13:22:10","24","Security Journal"

All actors in the society starting from the decision makers, scientists, academia and civil society must be aware that when new technologies are developed, which are capable of opening new dimensions of communication, transport or development, there must be comprehensive evaluation not only of the positive effects but also about the potential negative side effects of these new kind of products and services which very easily could be used by &nbsp;individuals or groups for jeopardizing the citizens security and overall public safety. Furthermore, the implementation of new technologies by law enforcement agencies on the other side raises the question of proper implementation of human rights standards and legal accountability. This analysis is also giving a short overview of the law enforcement capabilities regarding new innovations and technologies in three EU candidate countries: Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia. These countries are into EU accession process and they need to harmonize their national legislations with EU acquis and achieve full interoperability with the EU agencies. Recommendations for improvement of the capabilities for adopting new technologies and innovation in the day-to-day operational functioning of the police forces and law enforcement agencies in these three EU candidate countries are also proposed on the end of this analysis.</p>","https://bulletin.cepol.europa.eu/index.php/bulletin/article/view/346","2018-12-19 10:06:39","35","European Law Enforcement Research Bulletin"

                  <p>Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a prevalent and serious public health problem. Alcohol use and misuse is one of the most well-known antecedents of IPV perpetration. However, minimal research examined whether alcohol use increases the risk for IPV perpetration among individuals who identify as a sexual minority (i.e., lesbian, gay, bisexual, or another non-heterosexual identity [LGB+]). This is particularly concerning given that rates of IPV and alcohol use are as high, if not higher, in LGB+ populations relative to their heterosexual peers. In this article we provide a brief review of existing alcohol-related IPV research among LGB+ populations, advance an integrated model of alcohol-related IPV perpetration among LGB+ populations, and discuss avenues for future research on this topic. Our review identified limited research on alcohol-related IPV perpetration among LGB+ populations, with no longitudinal or event level research on this topic. Incorporating tenets of minority stress models with models of alcohol-related IPV (i.e., I<sup>3</sup> and Alcohol Myopia Theory), we propose an integrated theory of alcohol-related IPV perpetration among LGB+ populations. Based on the limited information available in the literature, our integrated theoretical model suggests several avenues for future research on alcohol-related IPV perpetration among LGB+ populations. We discuss these future areas for research and the importance of incorporating sexual minority stress frameworks into these investigations.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-0031-z","2018-12-19 12:20:54","16","Journal of Family Violence"

                  <p>This study investigates the relationship between land use, walkability, and the outcomes of neighborhood crime rates of larceny and aggravated assault. We use a combination of OLS regression models, harmonic analysis of diurnal patterns, and geospatial statistical techniques to examine the spatial patterning of larceny and aggravated assault in 782 Census blocks in Miami-Dade County, Florida with long-term data from 2007 to 2015. The results show that neighborhoods (i.e., Census block clusters) with higher levels of walkability have greater levels of aggravated assault. We also find that the increasing land-use diversity increases both aggravated assault and larceny. Finally, aggravated assault peaks during late night hours, while larceny peaks during daytime hours. Based on the results of our study using conventional and geospatial analyses, routine activity and social disorganization theories of neighborhood crime are partially supported, in that more motivated offenders and potential targets increase crime rates, while increased guardianship and informal social control reduce crime rates. The results of this study have important implications for security experts, law-enforcement agencies, and urban planning policy specialists focused on reducing crime in metropolitan areas. It is also relevant for theoretical frameworks designed to explain and predict temporal and spatial crime patterning.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1057/s41284-018-00161-7","2018-12-19 14:07:34","54","Security Journal"
"14123","Perception of Police Legitimacy Among Private Security Officers","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>The private security market is growing around the world, and public police are no longer the predominant agents of order maintenance and crime prevention. This development has important implications as different policing agents come in contact with each other. Specifically, understanding how they view each other can help increase the benefits of today&rsquo;s paradigm of security governance. Despite abundant research on citizen perceptions of police, few studies explore private security officers&rsquo; opinions about their public counterparts. Therefore, this research explores private security officers&rsquo; perceptions of the police in South Korea. Results show that the respondents&rsquo; attitudes toward police performance and distributive and procedural justice have varying influences on the three dimensions of police legitimacy: Obligation to obey, trust, and normative alignment. Additionally, the authors suggest the police should understand that private security officers&rsquo; perceptions of police legitimacy are influenced by distinct factors depending on contact experience and employment type.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1057/s41284-018-00163-5","2018-12-19 14:07:34","68","Security Journal"
"14124","The Change Up Project: Using Social Norming Theory With Young People to Address Domestic Abuse and Promote Healthy Relationships","<h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>This paper presents the findings of a secondary analysis of data collected during a pilot project, <em>Change Up</em>, which used a social norming approach (SNA) to address domestic violence and abuse (DVA) with young people aged 13&ndash;14. A SNA is based upon a well-articulated theory of behavior and evidence-based methodology for addressing social justice issues. This reflects a paradigm shift focusing upon strengths and positives, rather than pathologizing behaviors. Adopting a SNA, the <em>Change Up</em> project comprised a baseline survey followed by the intervention (workshop and peer-to-peer campaign), ending with a post-intervention survey. It was delivered in two high schools in a UK city between 2015 and 16. A secondary analysis of the survey data collected during the surveys and qualitative data collected at the end of each workshop was undertaken and this is reported here. <em>Change Up</em> data illustrates that most young people in the sample thought that DVA is unacceptable. There was, however, a gender difference in the norms held about the social acceptability of girls using physical violence against boys (and vice versa). The analysis of <em>Change Up</em> data indicates that a social norming approach to DVA programs aimed at young people can be successful in promoting attitude and behavior change. It also highlights a continuing need for young people&rsquo;s education about relationships and gender equality.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-0026-9","2018-12-19 18:24:27","18","Journal of Family Violence"

                  <p>Although childhood violence by any person is negative for children, little is known about whether violence by different family members is linked differently to problems in young adulthood, as family relationships might play different roles in children&rsquo;s individual development. In this study, we examine parent and sibling violence and associations with emotional and behavioral problems, directly and indirectly via peer victimization. We used retrospective reports from 347 young adults (aged 20&ndash;24) who all reported childhood family physical violence, and we performed a path analysis using Mplus. The results showed that participants who had been victimized by a sibling <em>only</em> or by <em>both</em> a sibling and parent were more likely to report peer victimization than were participants who had been victimized by parents <em>only</em>. Peer victimization was, in turn, linked to more aggression, criminality, and anxiety. Theoretical and clinical implications of these results are discussed.</p>","http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10896-018-0029-6","2018-12-26 17:33:15","27","Journal of Family Violence"

"14179","Police Candidate Selection: Assessing the Effectiveness of Pre-Employment Polygraph Screening","<span><div>Abstract</div>The majority of law enforcement agencies in the USA use pre-employment polygraph screening as a pass/fail criterion for prospective applicants. However, the polygraph has a number of unresolved practical and theoretical issues that are pronounced in the pre-employment screening context. After reviewing the literature in 2003, the National Research Council concluded there is a strong risk that pre-employment polygraph screening may erroneously exclude a large number of otherwise suitable candidates. Meanwhile, police departments face increasing difficulties finding qualified candidates to hire, and are often unable to keep pace with force attrition due to retirements and other factors. In light of these facts, this study attempts to determine if the polygraph is an effective means of filtering undesirable candidates by comparing data on police officer arrests between states that mandate pre-employment polygraph screening for law enforcement personnel and those that forbid the practice as a matter of law. The results were both surprising and completely contrary to initial expectations. It was found that states using the polygraph have significantly fewer years of service at the time of arrest and more per-capita arrests than police agencies in states that forbid the practice. Based on these results and a review of the polygraph literature, this study concludes that sole reliance on polygraph results as a pass/fail criterion for police hiring is a misguided practice.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay099/5262289?rss=1","2018-12-27 07:49:35","180","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"
"14180","How Do Undergraduate Students Construct Their View of Cybercrime? Exploring Definitions of Cybercrime, Perceptions of Online Risk and Victimization","<span><div>Abstract</div>While cybercrime is recognized as an increasing problem in society, it is unclear how users perceive cybercrime and online risks. This qualitative study explored how undergraduate students in England, a group who are at relatively high risk of victimization, viewed language and concepts associated with cybercrime. Three focus groups were conducted with a total of 16 18- to 21-year-old undergraduate students, and data were analyzed inductively and thematically. The themes explored in this article include: the physical world versus the virtual world; confusion regarding the law (including a perceived lack of police interest in responding to cybercrime); the normalization of risky or harmful online behaviour; and victimization. The themes also point towards a variety of misconceptions about cybercrime alongside an ambivalence towards the potential risk of becoming a victim. The data provide a potential step towards tailoring education packages and awareness programmes to ensure at-risk groups are equipped with actionable mechanisms to protect themselves. Further research is suggested in terms of exploring how such perceptions can be changed through effective training and awareness programmes, potentially reducing the level of risk in this group.</span>","https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/pay098/5262277?rss=1","2018-12-27 07:49:35","62","Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice"
