[CrimPapers](http://lesscrime.info/crimpapers/) is a service that provides 
alerts on new papers published in criminology, criminal justice and related
journals. Alerts are available as a [daily email](http://lesscrime.info/crimpapers/today/),
[weekly email](http://lesscrime.info/crimpapers/thisweek/), [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/CrimPapers) or [RSS feed](http://lesscrime.info/crimpapers/rss/). As of the end of 2018, about
4,300 people subscribe to CrimPapers alerts in one format or another.
The service is completely free: [sign up or get more information](http://lesscrime.info/crimpapers/).

We can use the information gathered to generate these alerts to find out more
about what gets published in criminology journals. Unfortunately, journal
publishers only provide very limited information about articles, so this 
analysis is largely based on article titles. Hopefully in future publishers will
provide more information in their RSS feeds. In the meantime, this is a basic look at what got published in 2018.

# There are more than 100 criminology journals

As of the end of 2018, CrimPapers tracks articles in **[`r nrow(journals)`
criminology journals](http://lesscrime.info/crimpapers/list/)**, including 
criminal justice, penology and terrorism. This is more criminology journals 
than I would ever have guessed existed before starting a list of them, yet the 
number is rising: *[Annual Review of Criminology](http://www.annualreviews.org/journal/criminol)* 
and *[Justice Evaluation Journal](https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rjej20)* 
launched this year, on top of several launches in 2017.

There were `r nrow(publishers)` publishers producing criminology journals in 
2018. Three publishers (`r paste(head(publishers$publisher, 3), sep = ", ")`)
released more than three quarters of all articles this year, while three others
(`r paste(tail(publishers$publisher, 3), sep = ", ")`) released fewer than 10
articles each.

```{r journals by topic, echo=FALSE}
journals_by_category <- journals %>%
  group_by(category) %>% 
  summarise(journals = n(), articles = sum(n_articles)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(journals))

specialist_journal_count <- journals_by_category %>% 
  filter(category != "general/regional") %>% 
  summarise(sum = sum(journals)) %>% 
  pull(sum)

cj_journal_count <- journals_by_category %>% 
  filter(category %in% c("criminal justice", "policing", "penology")) %>% 
  summarise(sum = sum(journals)) %>% 
  pull(sum)
```

As well as general criminology journals such as *[Criminology](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1745-9125)*
and the various national and regional journals, there are over 
`r round(specialist_journal_count / 10) * 10` specialist journals covering
different topics. These journals can be approximately categorized as:

```{r table of journals by topic, echo=FALSE}
journals_by_category %>% 
  mutate(
    articles = scales::percent(articles / sum(articles), accuracy = 1),
    row = ifelse(category == "other", 10^4, row_number())
  ) %>% 
  arrange(row) %>% 
  select(-row) %>% 
  rename_all(str_to_title) %>% 
  knitr::kable(align = c("l", "r", "r"))
```

The number of journals focused on criminal justice, policing and penology
(`r cj_journal_count` journals between the three categories) indicates the focus
of criminologists on formal responses to crime. Conversely, there is only one
specialist journal for crime prevention
(*[Crime Prevention and Community Safety](http://www.palgrave-journals.com/cpcs/)*)
and no specialist journals for topics such as crime analysis.

There are fewer journals focused on specific types of crime, but again these
perhaps indicate the topics that primarily interest criminologists. Violence,
sex offending and terrorism are the only crime types with more than two 
specialist journals. There are many common and important crime types that have
only one specialist journal (such as *[Journal of Financial Crime](http://www.emeraldinsight.com/loi/jfc)*) or no journals at all. Articles
covering these crime types can of-course be published in general criminology
journals, but authors may face the additional hurdle of editors wanting content
that has general applicability. This may mean there is less of an evidence base
for types of crime that are not fashionable enough to have their own journals.


# There are more criminology articles than you can possibly read

In 2018 there were **`r format(nrow(articles), big.mark = ",")` different 
articles** published in criminology journals, an average of 
`r format(nrow(articles) / 365, big.mark = ",", digits = 0)` per day or
`r format(nrow(articles) / 52, big.mark = ",", digits = 0)` per week.
*`r head(journals$name, 1)`*, published by `r head(journals$publisher, 1)`, 
released `r format(head(journals$n_articles, 1), big.mark = ",")` articles 
during the year (an average of `r format(head(journals$n_articles, 1) / 12, big.mark = ",", digits = 0)` 
a month), which suggests an impressive amount of editorial work. 
<!--
`r vector_in_text(pull(mutate(filter(journals, n_articles > 100), name = paste0("*", name, "*")), "name"))` all published more than 100 articles during the year.
-->

The median journal published `r format(median(journals$n_articles), digits = 0)`
articles during the year, with half of journals (including all of the top five
by impact factor) publishing between `r format(quantile(journals$n_articles, 0.25), digits = 0)` 
and `r format(quantile(journals$n_articles, 0.75), digits = 0)` articles each.

    axis.text.y = element_blank(),
    legend.position = "none",
    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()
  )
```

We can explore the subjects of journal articles by looking for the most-common
words and two- and three-word phrases in article titles.

```{r word frequency, echo=FALSE}
common_ngrams <- list()

common_ngrams[["single words"]] <- articles %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, title) %>% 
  anti_join(get_stopwords(), by = "word") %>% 
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  filter(!word %in% c("among", "â", "s", "review", "analysis", "study", "role", 
                      "factors", "impact", "based", "case", "effects",
                      "research", "use"))

common_ngrams[["two-word phrases"]] <- articles %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, title, token = "ngrams", n = 2) %>% 
  separate(word, c("word1", "word2"), sep = " ", remove = FALSE) %>% 
  anti_join(get_stopwords(), by = c("word1" = "word")) %>% 
  anti_join(get_stopwords(), by = c("word2" = "word")) %>% 
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  filter(!word %in% c("intimate partner", "partner violence", "child sexual",
                      "womenâ s"))

common_ngrams[["three-word phrases"]] <- articles %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, title, token = "ngrams", n = 3) %>% 
  separate(word, c("word1", "word2", "word3"), sep = " ", remove = FALSE) %>% 
  anti_join(get_stopwords(), by = c("word1" = "word")) %>% 
  anti_join(get_stopwords(), by = c("word2" = "word")) %>% 
  anti_join(get_stopwords(), by = c("word3" = "word")) %>% 
  count(word, sort = TRUE)

common_ngrams <- common_ngrams %>% 
  bind_rows(.id = "type") %>% 
  remove_missing(na.rm = TRUE) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  group_by(type) %>% 
  slice(1:10) %>% 
  mutate(rank = row_number()) %>% 
  ungroup()

common_ngrams %>% 
  mutate(
    type = factor(type, levels = c("single words", "two-word phrases",
                                   "three-word phrases")),
    word = paste0(word, " (", n, ")"),
    word = reorder(word, n)
  ) %>%
  select(-n) %>% 
  spread(type, word) %>% 
  # mutate(rank = english::ordinal(rank)) %>% 
  rename_all(str_to_title) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```


Again we see particular focus on violence (especially intimate partner violence
and child abuse) and the criminal justice system. Also evident in the two- and
three-word phrases are criminological methods such as the systematic review and
the randomized controlled trial. Some currently popular topics are also present,
including body-worn video cameras ("body worn" appeared in `r nrow(filter(articles, str_detect(str_replace_all(str_to_lower(title), "-", " "), "body worn")))` article titles) and adverse childhood experiences ("adverse 
childhood" appeared in `r nrow(filter(articles, str_detect(str_to_lower(title), "adverse childhood")) %>% select(title))` article titles).

We can also look at the words that most-often modify (i.e. appear directly 
before) the most-common single words:


```{r echo=FALSE}
most_common_1grams <- common_ngrams %>% 
  gather(key, value, -type) %>% 
  filter(type == "single words") %>% 
  slice(1:10) %>% 
  pull(value)

articles %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, title, token = "ngrams", n = 2) %>% 
  separate(word, c("word1", "word2"), sep = " ", remove = FALSE) %>% 
  anti_join(get_stopwords(), by = c("word1" = "word")) %>% 
  anti_join(get_stopwords(), by = c("word2" = "word")) %>% 
  filter(word2 %in% most_common_1grams, word1 != "s") %>% 
  mutate(word = str_replace_all(word, "â", "")) %>% 
  group_by(word) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  separate(word, c("word1", "word2"), sep = " ", remove = FALSE) %>% 
  group_by(word2) %>% 
  slice(1:5) %>% 
  mutate(word1 = paste0(word1, " (", n, ")")) %>% 
  summarise(modifiers = paste(word1, collapse = ", ")) %>% 
  mutate(word2 = factor(word2, levels = most_common_1grams)) %>% 
  arrange(word2) %>% 
  rename(`most-common word` = word2, `most-common modifiers` = modifiers) %>% 
  rename_all(str_to_title) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

Looking at word co-occurrence like this mainly confirms the patterns we've 
already seen, but gives some additional information about the types of risk
and justice commonly mentioned in article titles.

Some specialist journals publish large numbers of papers (`r vector_in_text(pull(mutate(filter(journals, n_articles > 100), name = paste0("*", name, "*")), "name"))` all published more than 100
articles in 2018), which may skew the most-common topics. Restricting the search
for common words and phrases to only the 
`r nrow(filter(journals, category == "general/regional"))` general and regional
journals produces somewhat different results. Terms that do not appear in the
corresponding table for all journals are marked in bold.

```{r general word frequency, echo=FALSE}
general_ngrams <- list()

general_articles <- articles %>% 
  left_join(journals, by = c("journal" = "name")) %>% 
  filter(category == "general/regional")

general_ngrams[["single words"]] <- general_articles %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, title) %>% 
  anti_join(get_stopwords(), by = "word") %>% 
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  filter(!word %in% c("among", "â", "s", "review", "analysis", "study", "role", 
                      "factors", "impact", "based", "case", "effects",
                      "research", "use"))

general_ngrams[["two-word phrases"]] <- general_articles %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, title, token = "ngrams", n = 2) %>% 
  separate(word, c("word1", "word2"), sep = " ", remove = FALSE) %>% 
  anti_join(get_stopwords(), by = c("word1" = "word")) %>% 
  anti_join(get_stopwords(), by = c("word2" = "word")) %>% 
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  filter(!word %in% c("intimate partner", "partner violence", "child sexual",
                      "womenâ s"))

general_ngrams[["three-word phrases"]] <- general_articles %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, title, token = "ngrams", n = 3) %>% 
  separate(word, c("word1", "word2", "word3"), sep = " ", remove = FALSE) %>% 
  anti_join(get_stopwords(), by = c("word1" = "word")) %>% 
  anti_join(get_stopwords(), by = c("word2" = "word")) %>% 
  anti_join(get_stopwords(), by = c("word3" = "word")) %>% 
  count(word, sort = TRUE)

general_ngrams %>% 
  bind_rows(.id = "type") %>%

                                   "three-word phrases")),
    word = ifelse(is.na(type_common), paste0("**", word, "**"), word),
    word = paste0(word, " (", n, ")"),
    word = reorder(word, n)
  ) %>%

```


Criminology, like all academic disciplines, uses its share of jargon. Excluding
the most common 40,000 or so English words using a 
[dictionary word list](http://wordlist.aspell.net/12dicts-readme/#nof12) leaves 
only 'uncommon' or jargon words, the most-frequent of which are:


```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# word list obtained from http://wordlist.aspell.net/12dicts-readme/#nof12
word_list <- read_table("./2of12inf.txt", col_names = c("word"), 
           col_types = cols(word = col_character())) %>% 
  mutate(
    neologism = ifelse(str_detect(word, "!"), TRUE, FALSE),
    word = str_remove_all(word, "\\W+?") # "\\!|\\$|\\+|\\~|\\=|\\%"
  ) %>%
  filter(neologism == FALSE) %>%
  select(word)

These mostly represent technical terms ('post traumatic', 'cybercrime') or 
initials ('ISIS', 'PTSD') but also some neologisms ('responsivity' doesn't yet
appear to have made it into dictionaries) and topical terms such as 'ferguson'.

# Articles that subscribers are interested in tend to be applied studies

While it's only a *very* approximate measure of article popularity, CrimPapers
records whenever a subscriber clicks on an article link in an email update, 
tweet or RSS item. There are obviously better metrics of interest, but these
tend not to be widely available (such as downloads, which not all publishers
release) or slow to emerge (such as citations, which are dependent on publishing
processes). 

The median article was clicked on `r round(median(articles$clicks))` times,
mostly from Twitter. CrimPapers subscribers are a mixture of academics, policy
professionals and practitioners, generally (as far as I can tell through an
unsystematic survey of Twitter profiles) with or studying for a PhD. The 20 
articles those subscribers clicked on most in 2018 were:

```{r echo=FALSE}
articles %>% 
  arrange(desc(clicks)) %>% 
  top_n(20, clicks) %>% 
  mutate(
    rank = row_number(),
    title = str_replace_all(title, coll("â€™"), "'"),
    title = str_replace_all(title, coll("â€œ"), "'"),
    title = str_replace_all(title, coll("â€˜"), "'"),
    title = str_replace_all(title, coll("â€"), "'"),
    title = paste0("[", title, "](", link, "), ", journal)
  ) %>% 
  select(rank, title, clicks) %>% 
  rename_all(str_to_title) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

The top 14 articles all come from different journals, including journals that
are not among what might be considered the top journals in the field. With some
exceptions, popular articles tend to be on applied topics, which may reflect the
the practitioners and policy professions among subscribers. In particular, the
only journal to appear more than once (*[Policing: a Journal of Policy and Practice](http://policing.oxfordjournals.org/)*) was specifically established to 
publish research of interest to practitioners, and requires authors to submit 
articles with that in mind (e.g. by setting a low word limit).


# Article titles matter

For reasons of space, CrimPapers alerts consist only of the article title, the
journal and a link to the full text. For example, a CrimPapers tweet looks like:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">“School Variation in Offending: A Macro-Level Strain Approach” in Eur J Criminol <a href="https://t.co/zv5QBNgBjj">https://t.co/zv5QBNgBjj</a></p>&mdash; Criminology Papers (@CrimPapers) <a href="https://twitter.com/CrimPapers/status/1079723035366690817?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 31, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 
<script async src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

For this reason, the usefulness of an article title is likely to be important in
piquing the interest of readers. This is equally true for potential readers who
are searching on Google Scholar or other platforms, so authors should give some
thought to their title choices.

Unfortunately, not all articles have titles that facilitate interest. There are
various problems with article titles, but some of the more common ones are easy
to eliminate. The first is the generic title that could be applied to any 
article on the topic, with no indication of the article's particular 
contribution. For example:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">“Police Use of Body Worn Cameras” in Police Pract Res <a href="https://t.co/ohMS5TVV5t">https://t.co/ohMS5TVV5t</a></p>&mdash; Criminology Papers (@CrimPapers) <a href="https://twitter.com/CrimPapers/status/1075349147379793920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 19, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

which could have been the title of any of the `r pull(filter(common_ngrams, word == "body worn"), "n")`
articles that mentioned 'body worn' in the title in 2018. The second is the 
title beset by [academic word soup](https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/23/zombie-nouns/),
such as:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">“The Illusion of Resistance: Commodification and Reification of Neoliberalism and the State” in Crit Criminol <a href="https://t.co/CLkPSjFD2z">https://t.co/CLkPSjFD2z</a></p>&mdash; Criminology Papers (@CrimPapers) <a href="https://twitter.com/CrimPapers/status/916217731808153600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 6, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

or:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">“The Consumption of Patriarchy: Commodification to Facilitation and Reification” in Contemp Justice Rev <a href="https://t.co/5fCRBIb8rr">https://t.co/5fCRBIb8rr</a></p>&mdash; Criminology Papers (@CrimPapers) <a href="https://twitter.com/CrimPapers/status/847379136234389505?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 30, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

A useful rule-of-thumb here may be that a reasonably educated non-specialist 
should be able to read at least the article title without having to reach for a
dictionary.

A related problem is titles that make enigmatic reference only to a case study 
or analogy that will be explained in the text but means nothing to a person
reading the title (either on CrimPapers or anywhere else). For example:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">“From Passengers to Crew: Introductory Reflections” in Crime Law Soc Change <a href="https://t.co/Can9IW8FK6">https://t.co/Can9IW8FK6</a></p>&mdash; Criminology Papers (@CrimPapers) <a href="https://twitter.com/CrimPapers/status/888026974949605376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 20, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

or

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">“Justice For Ms Dhu” in Soc Legal Stud <a href="https://t.co/RYOq8DAp8Y">https://t.co/RYOq8DAp8Y</a></p>&mdash; Criminology Papers (@CrimPapers) <a href="https://twitter.com/CrimPapers/status/919909560143532033?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 16, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

In both cases these are the full article titles. Uninformative titles seem to be
particularly common in special issues (there were several articles simply titled
'Introduction'). This is probably because editors are thinking of the special
issue as a single (paper bound) document, whereas readers are probably more
likely to find special-issue articles in the same way they find any other 
article: by doing a keyword search in their favored search engine. This is
particularly true now that special-issue articles are sometimes released online
one-by-one as copy editing is finished. This is just one of many ways academics'
thinking about publishing hasn't caught up with the realities of online 
journals.

So, what does a good article title look like? At the very least, a title should
set out the subject of the study such that it can be distinguished from other
related works. For example:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">“Are College-Educated Police Officers Different? A Study of Stops, Searches, and Arrests” in Crim Justice Policy Rev <a href="https://t.co/OTvC7rGKoF">https://t.co/OTvC7rGKoF</a></p>&mdash; Criminology Papers (@CrimPapers) <a href="https://twitter.com/CrimPapers/status/1075359694422769665?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 19, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

Perhaps even better though is to give the *answer* to your question in the 
title. This is much more common in other disciplines, but is quite rare in
criminology. When people do this, however, it's very useful. For example:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">“The Use of Victim Video Statements in Family Violence Cases Increases the Rate of Early Guilty Pleas” in J Interpers Violence <a href="https://t.co/njbKy2sFoQ">https://t.co/njbKy2sFoQ</a></p>&mdash; Criminology Papers (@CrimPapers) <a href="https://twitter.com/CrimPapers/status/1075118376199090176?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 18, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
